## ODM (Object Data Modeling)

An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library is used in the context of NoSQL databases, particularly document-based databases like MongoDB. ODMs, like Mongoose for MongoDB, provide a way to model application data using JavaScript objects. They typically offer schema-based solutions, allowing developers to define the structure of their data models and enforce validation rules. ODMs translate data between the database's document format and JavaScript objects in the application.

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library is used in the context of relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. ORMs, like Sequelize for Node.js, provide a way to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming languages like JavaScript or Python. They map database tables to classes or objects in the application code, allowing developers to manipulate data using familiar object-oriented paradigms. ORMs handle tasks such as database queries, transactions, and data relationships, abstracting away the underlying SQL queries.

### Key Differences:

1. **Database Type**: <u>ODMs are used with NoSQL databases, while ORMs are used with relational databases.</u>
  
2. **Data Modeling Approach**: ODMs typically use schema-based data modeling, whereas ORMs map database tables to application objects/classes.
  
3. **Validation and Schema Enforcement**: ODMs often include built-in support for defining and enforcing data validation rules through schemas. ORMs may provide validation features, but they are typically less rigid than ODMs due to the flexibility of relational database schemas.
  
4. **Query Language**: ORMs abstract away the SQL query language, providing a more object-oriented interface for interacting with the database. ODMs usually work with the native query language of the NoSQL database they are designed for.
