## Instructions

### **PREP VEGETABLES**

1. Finely chop the garlic cloves. Grate a small knob of ginger (2 tsp).

2. Thinly slice the green onion, separating the white and green. Cut the shishito peppers in half or bite-sized pieces.

### **MAKE SAUCE**

1. In a small container, mix together the soy sauce, honey, sugar, oyster sauce, mirin, chicken bouillon powder, cornstarch, and water.

2. Optionally, add 1 finely chopped dried chili (or peperoncino).

### **MAKE SOY GLAZED CHICKEN**

1. Pat dry the chicken with paper towel. Lightly season both sides with salt and pepper. Coat them with cornstarch, making sure it’s evenly coated and shake off the excess. (The cornstarch will help the skin get extra crispy and it will help the sauce to adhere later on.)

2. In a pan, heat the oil (2 tbsp) over **medium-high heat**. Once it gets nice and hot, place the chicken **_skin-side down_**. Once the bottom turns golden brown, flip and cook the other side. (The total cooking time will be about **8 minutes**.) Once the chicken is cooked through, remove from the pan and set aside.

3. Into the same pan, throw in the garlic, ginger, and white parts of the green onions. Saute for **30 seconds** or until fragrant.
