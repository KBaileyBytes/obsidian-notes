# Lost in Space 
#### November 24, 2022 

Just a word to friends that many have not received my last posting. Either it did not come or it went to junk mail. Of all the ones to lose because I am not going through that again. Anyway snoop around if you think you missed some big news.  
  
On a side note, today was a good day. No it was a great day. Any day your name is not in the obit column qualifies as a good day. I checked. All good. and tomorrow we start again.

# Who left all these footprints around here?
#### November 21, 2022 

Well, another round is over and I felt every second of it. I have done 29 nonstop rounds of chemotherapy. I had some good days and some bad. In fact, I had some terrible days and even a couple of decent sessions where I thought I could ride this train forever but that is not the case. 

My oncology team met with me, and we have decided to suspend all future chemo sessions. Without being too technical, my quality of life was not made better by the exercise of the infusion chair and carrying a pump for days afterward. There was a minimal change at the very beginning, but it was too small and the impact disappeared quickly. 

So where does that leave me? I have exhausted all treatment options and there is nothing left now to do except finish this road to its completion. This is where the terminal part kicks into to the equation. The unknown is timing. It could take a couple of seasons or even as short as a few months. We are going to let my system recover and recharge and meet again just before Christmas. The top doc feels this will not be dragged out for a long time period. But again everyone reacts differently. My cancer is growing at twice the expected normal rate, if you can consider the disease spread as a normal. Pretty bad news yet I have powerful ally on my side and I will explain shortly. 

Can I vent for a second? My blog and I say yes so here goes. Do you have foot prints in your house? I don’t mean dirt or muddy tracks leaving a trail like a Circus Life cartoon. I mean that schmaltzy story about a man looking back at his life with the lord and seeing he was not alone during the worst parts of his life but the single set of tracks meant that the Lord was carrying him. Cute image designed to challenge the unsaved and encourage the saved. 

But let’s look at it through the eyes of Winnipeg or as I say reality. First all, how does the Lord carry me. Before I got sick, I was tickling the scale just over 200 lbs. That is an awkward carry. You can’t do that and not keep from getting winded. Would it be a cradle carry, or a fireman’s carry or maybe a piggyback. Perhaps like a roll of old carpet. Yes, that’s it. The creator of the universe giving me a piggyback ride through life. The little tale is usually partnered with a beautiful beach scene with a set of footprints in the sand and under a blazing sun, by a sapphire sea and aging palm tree which has weathered the storms of life. Let’s replace the sunny sky with an eternal grey and the old palm tree can step down and be replaced by a snowman None of the options bring a vision of awe, or comfort, peace etc. And lets forget the footprints single or paired in the sand. If you look outside, you will see the Lord actually carried you down the long snow packed driveway to the windrow left by the city. 

Yes, the sentiment is very true. God does not forsake us when times are tough. He has certainly not abandoned me since I have been dying. Here is the truth: you have been dying just the same as I have. I wrote this once. You cannot see around a curve. Whether it be illness or accident your time here can suddenly come to an end. 

I said I have a powerful ally. The second part of Hebrews 13:5 says never will I leave you, never will I forsake you. God is saying that to me. Wow. So undeserving and unworthy. But not worthless. People have a tendency to measure themselves and come up with a conclusion that they are worthless. That is just fresh fertilizer. You may be unworthy but not worthless. God created you knowing about the flaws and failures and he didn’t stop. On the contrary, he created you and me with the invitation to come and conform to Him. He didn’t say the road would be easy either. Matthew 11:28 reads  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” I have leaned on that promise so much in the last 16 months. So I have the “Great Wait” ahead of me, but God promised me that I am not alone. I am in some great company. 

So the next steps for me: I drop several of the meds and infusion sessions of chemotherapy. I am being enrolled in a palliative home care program where I stay at home as long as I am comfortable. The doctors and nurses will come see me. Once that hits a certain point, I will move into residence at Riverview or St Boniface Hospital. My understanding is that will be the last of the visitors at that point. 

The palliative care program’s primary goal is to make me pain free. Still more pills to try I guess. Though I can swallow them, still don’t like them. 

So, there is the news. I am not closing my site down yet. I feel that God and I may have more to share, even in our limited time. 

Love and peace to all. And thanks for all your prayers. The end is in sight but I still need them. 

Dale

# Stuff about my stuff
#### October 25, 2022 

In the next few hours, I will be making the trek down to the hospital once again for chemo treatment. Thus far, there has been little change. No cures or healing but there have been no new negative steps either. I have been up for hours and find it difficult to rest. My mind takes me to many places and today dear friend, I will take you along with me.

In my September 5th journal posting I wrote at length about how I relate to different people different ways. Today the lesson is simpler but still carries some weight. It is not my relationships that define me but my stuff.

I have stuff. Lots of stuff. Stuff to take care of my stuff. Stuff in my garage. Stuff in my basement. Stuff for inside the house and stuff for outside the house. I have big stuff. I have small stuff. I have stuff that is cheap and then I have stuff which is quite valuable. Sometimes I have only one stuff and others I have lots of the same stuff. One stuff two stuff red stuff blue stuff. Old stuff and new stuff. Common stuff and rare stuff. Edible stuff (one of my favorites) and stuff just for show. Some stuff I bought; some stuff has been gifts. Some stuff has been created and some stuff has always been. Some stuff is for sharing and and some stuff is not. Stuff to bring joy and pleasure and stuff that don’t. Stuff that never breaks and stuff that never works. A lifetime of stuff. Part of my lesson today comes from a blueberry.

Being terminally ill does bring some periods of pragmatic thoughts. I spent the better part of summer cleaning the garage and it is still not done. You see there is clean (item put where it can be found) and there is cleaner ( item has a spot and every spot has an item) and then there is Darth Kathy clean ( item is dirt free, in it’s intended storage place and fully functional and needed. The empress cannot stand having stuff that serves no obvious purpose)

So during one of these gusto cleaning sessions, she legitimately asked what she was supposed to do with all my stuff after I leave this party. It was a good question. She certainly does not need a key cutting machine or a 100 year old bank lock. She doesn’t need any stuff because she has her own. We all do.

Ask any chemo and they will tell you in a heartbeat that they would trade their stuff to avoid an early check out. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Well if we didn’t then how would we know the difference between small stuff and large stuff. The point is we all have to deal with stuff.

There is different stuff. Intellectual Stuff and emotional stuff and physical stuff. There is imaginable stuff and very tangible stuff. Bottom line are things that are in direct competition with our relationship with God. Could be little or lots. Possibly facing an early end has brought me to think about my stuff and the empress’ question: what to do with all that stuff. It is overwhelming to think but it will be easy to divest my stuff. As long as there are men in our lives, they will be willing to take stuff as most of it is tools and man toys.

But I though of other people with more and less stuff. How easy it is for those with less to take that which he does not have. Or how simple it is for a well off financially individual to run out and buy what he wants with no thought of cost. Do you get envious of our rich friend? I know some time I do. I have a huge wish list: a car that doesn’t need maintenance, radial arm saw, table saw, furniture that matches, (are you watching Santa) dishwasher with a no talk mode I mean silent mode, new laptop, new cell phone etc. You get the idea. There are things I want and need to survive. God has provided what I need. One of his names is Jehovah Jireh which is God my provider. He supplies my needs. It is not Jehovah Claus where a fat old guy with a white beard burdens you with stuff. I mean I am even close to that description. No comments please

The first part of that verse is actually a warning to watch out, be careful or take heed or take notice of being covetous or wanting of what we do not have

So my lessons

   - Be careful of wanting of what you do not have. Recently a lottery was a 70 million dollar prize. How obscene. Greater men have fallen by much less. There is nothing with wanting what you don't have as long as it doesn’t become your priority. We have been told to ask and pray continually for things. But a poor witness we make is when we care caught mumbling “lord please give me a new speed boat) God will give according to His plan and grace.

   - God will provide. I don’t have to worry about not having. I was in a tool store shopping. That is man style shopping. Looking at ways to make life easier or items to help with fixing stuff. Tools and gadgets. It is the opposite when shopping with the HER. I spend more time looking for her rather than the time finding what I was supposed to purchase. Advice to new husbands when shopping with the wife take cell phone and a map. Avoid discussing meeting place at all cost because when she is beside the bananas you are at another space of banana

I also get reminded of the miracle of feeding 5000 plus women and children. Given a small boys lunch. Jesus prayed and boom: Tuna fish sandwiches for everyone. a question to think about is who brought the 12 extra baskets. Did they put their name on the potluck baskets?

Jesus said in Luke 12:15 “a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” Contrary to my statement earlier, our value or worth does not depend on how much stuff we have when step down from the race. I will trust in Him. Case is point many times I find a deal, sometimes a good deal and occasionally a great deal. The lord has used some of you to meet our needs and sometimes our desires. To those who act on their faith and bless us, thank you and I pray specifically for you. God will provide and sometimes use you to do it, I love that verse. My worth is not my stuff and my friends don't qualify as stuff but you are part of my worth. Think on that over the next couple days if you will. What and where is your worth really?

17:22 time

> An old poor women had run out of food but she was full of faith. She prayed in a loud voice to God to bring her food. She prayed on and on and finally three young men heard her. Wanting to play a trick on her they stole various food items from the market. They wrapped in a bag and threw it through her window. Her prayer started again praising God and thanking Him. The punk kids were mad and yelled out “foolish woman, God didn’t give you the food we did’ There was a short pause of silence when the old woman cried yelled out “I don’t care if the devil brought it, God sent it.

And

> A man was in the bar boasting of his strength. I mean park at a picnic. He was trying to catch the attention of a pretty girl and challenged that he would squeeze a lemon so dry that no man could get another drop out it. She would have to date the winner. She accepted and hoped anyone else would win because lemons were full of fluid, and he couldn’t possibly get it all. But she got nervous when he squeezed that lemon. A glass caught all the juice and it was collected in a glass and quite full, Then challenger after challenger tried to add one drop and failed completely. She was worried about dating the egotistical guy. Seeing her distraught demeanour, a small lesser muscled man asked if she wanted to win or lose. She cried I want him to lose. So, our gentle friend came up to the well mangled lemon and shook off the laughter from the crowd as he picked up the lemon. He held his hand over the glass and squeezed not one but three more drops of lemon juice. Incredulous the people cheered and murmured to themselves and began to break out of the crowd. The young lady ran to her hero and praised him and asked how he did. “it is simple he said, I work for Revenue Canada.

# News flash #1
#### September 10, 2022 

Hello cowpokes…

A very quick update on my friend, Cancer. It seems the medical team has been right all along. It is a very aggressive strain of colon cancer, and it has decided to fight back against the treatment. So, the latest news: I still got it. The cancer has not spread any more BUT the cancer has grown. I was stage 4 before, now I guess I am 4.1 

Apparently, all the tumors and nodules have grown a significant, measurable amount. This doesn’t mean the treatments aren’t working but they aren’t enough to make my little friend disappear. For all that I have gone through it seems a little disappointing to do all this just to slow it down. I am still hoping for a full healing, but medical facts are a cold splash on your faith system.

There is some good news, I get a two week break in Chemo. There is more bad news: my cycles have been shortened to 8 weeks instead of 12. Just means more tests and doctor visits. Also, we are adding additional chems and taking out some others. I have been told that this is my final treatment option. There is nothing left to try. The neuropathy pain I have is awful and looking to be permanent long term or at least to the end.

So there you have all the news. I called cancer my friend earlier. I hope you know that I was being very sarcastic. It has been with me for 16 months now, 8 more than what was expected so I am sort of grateful.

It is with me every moment of every day and influences my life. But so does God. I am leaning on Him at this time and need your prayers. It is hard to stay upbeat when the future still calls you in for a dirt nap.

One of the hardest things to do in my journey is to have to face my kids and tell them that I am still dying. They grasp the facts but the truth still is finding its way to their heart, so please remember them. And my dear Kathy as well. Monday is our 30th anniversary. This is not how we wanted the focus to be.

Well, that’s it that’s all. We use caringbridge website share our news and some ramblings. I am just not strong enough to call you all and share. I would love the chance to fellowship with you all but my timing just won’t allow for it. The hour is very late or early depending what side of the day you are calling it. Time to get some rest. Good night

Take care.

Dale out.

# A Friendly Reminder
#### September 5, 2022 

Hello Boosters

Wishing you a fine Monday here. It is holiday for those who toil away during the rest of the year. Not counting Christmas, Easter, Family Day, Victoria Day, thanksgiving etc. not to mention weekends. Ok we get a lot of time off. I say enjoy what you can (Sept 21, 2021, journal) and while you can (Oct 15, 2021 journal). The weather has certainly cooperated and thus far it has been a superb weekend. Not counting my illness. This was session #6 of this round of Chemo. I now see a pattern where towards the end of my sessions (12 weeks chemo) I am the slowest to recover at the end and pain and discomfort are at their worst. I mean I like my house, but it doesn’t mean I want to spend all my available time in a 5’x7’ room with built in seating. I will not belabour the side effects of “getting better?” as I have done so in the past, but I will say progress is slow. I mean really slow. Like I mean it takes two trips to pass the salt and pepper kind of slow.

This week has some tests and ends with a big meeting with the oncologist on Friday. We have a little visit to discuss options and the tempting one is to make me as comfortable as possible while time plays out this little commercial. Ironic that I can only be made comfortable when not fighting the cancer. To get better, it seems a certain degree of suffering must take place. We can get 2 colors in a toothpaste tube but cannot seem to make this happen.

So, as it happens when the pain drives me awake and I pilgrimage to the living room couch to the comfort of her highness. I begin to think about deep thoughts and concepts that I normally try to avoid. You see, I have a big brain and a small heart. It is a fact. I lead my life with intellectual roots and not emotional ravings though it is a very emotional time for me and my family. Today’s thought came to me around 4 am. Yes 4:00 does happen twice a day. And at that unholy and dark hour I was asking “who am I?”

I am a man who wears many hats. To Safeway, I am a customer. To the bank, I am a customer and the reason for their existence. To mosquitoes, I am a food source. To my staff, I am their boss. To other locksmiths, I am a colleague. To the church, I am a member and fellow believer and servant. To my sister and brother, I am a brother. To my in laws, I am a son in law, with all the rights and privileges of a regular son but smarter and better looking. To my children, I am dad with all the corniness included. To Darth Kathy, my wife, I am husband and companion for nearly 30 years. I am also sometimes melonhead and some other choice phrases when I act before I normally think. To God. To God, I am His creation. Made with intent and purpose. His purpose. So what does that mean.

And finally, to my friends, I am a friend. It is a reciprocal relationship, and I do my best to be worthy of the title.

So I am husband, father, son, brother, uncle, nephew, grandson. I am also manager, client, patient, provider. I am a locksmith, safe technician, fire door assembly inspector, pen maker. I am a white, middle class, middle aged Canadian male with conservative political values and a fan of soft pretzels. Other adjectives can be added to my growing list but now I want to focus on one. I am also a friend. To many wonderful people I consider myself a friend. And I consider them as my friends. It is not the quantity of time spent together but the quality of our time. There are names from work, the neighborhood, the church, that can always bring a smile. During my time of cancer, they have been there in various ways. I cannot share details but they have gone above and beyond the definitions of friendship to reach out to me and my family. And I am so grateful.

What does the good book say about friendship. I turn to the Bible because even if my specific answer is not there, a nugget of wisdom is sitting there for me digest and apply.

John 15:13 says “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends”. I can honestly say that I have yet to sign up for that particular display of friendship. The cross is the ultimate example of this statement. Jesus died for you. For me. His friends. And such a death it was. Enduring the pain of a crucifixion as a display of enduring love. It was an act of which I am not worthy to receive but He says it is for all to come and join, to be a part of his plan, to spend eternity with your friend. And our only obligation is to accept and believe. Earlier in chapter 13 Jesus said to his bodyguards and crew “By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” How can we reflect God’s love if we can’t love our neighbor? I am not out there on an evangelical conversion trip. We got people to do that. I want my journey to include all those around me in a spirit of acceptance and love. Bottom line: if you know me, I want you to consider me a friend.

The book of proverbs is full of references to friendship. The importance of having them, keeping them and working them. It is not a tangible item with specific dimensions and purpose. It is a dynamic living entity. Without attention it may die.

As I said upstairs there, it is quality time not quantity of time or large numbers of friends that matter. I think we all have at least one person that we can count as “best friend”. Unfortunately, current media has turned the concept into a toy and the value of such relationships has been reduced to Disney sized sound bites. True friendship has been shown to me dozens of times and in just as many ways since the beginning of our cancer journey. We would be betraying confidences were we to share what amazing ways people have acted as the hands and feet of Jesus. This passage is long and hard, I do not understate it. But our load has been made much lighter because of our friends. So thank you all. God bless you and I hope that very soon time and health will allow me to reach so many of you and share a few laughs with an old friend.

Some thoughts for you:

I make pens. Writing instruments to be exact. It is a hobby that I picked up a few years ago and take a great deal of pleasure in my little world exercising my creative side. I love working with different type of woods. I get wood blanks of every type from all over the world. I have made pens out of trees that I didn’t even know existed. The wood is beautiful, and the names are wild. Bubinga, cocobolo, snake wood, ironwood, osage, marblewood, zebrawood, purple heart. I have even made pens out of old furniture like a table or old piano or from a special tree from grandma’s yard. I know, what can God teach you from a little stick?

Take the sassafras tree. It is known for having extremely deep roots. The deeper the stronger the tree. Sassafras has a wide use from everything from medicine to furniture. The Choctow people still use it to flavour beverages and season bear fat. There is heavy use in Louisiana Creole Gumbo. Great sounding tree, hope to work with it one day. In summary, deep strong roots gives you a strong tree

Now take the Japanese Maple tree. It can grow to heights of 20’ but the root system is only about a foot and a half. This beautiful specimen can brighten a yard but under even slightly harsh conditions it will falter under attack.

Thus it is similar to our friendships. Deep roots provide a strong tree. The shallow roots falter under moderate adversity. Root rot is a condition of neglect. My challenge to you my friend is to cultivate and work at your friendships to ensure deep roots.

Love to All

Dale

17:22 Time

My son and I had a routine at bed time when he was very small. Went something like this:

**Dad: ok, you have had 2 washroom breaks (never enough) and a water break (kind of break even point eh?) You brushed your teeth and washed your face. You kissed mommy good night and we said our prayers. Now it is time to sleep.**

_Son: OK. Tuck me in_.

**Dad: This is the last time. Now go to sleep**

_Son: OK Love you._

**Dad: love you too. (got sucked into that one) You’re my buddy**

_Son: You’re my buddy (whispered)_ 

**Dad: You’re my Chum** 

_Son: You’re my Chum_

**Dad: You’re my amigo** 

_Son: You’re my amigo_

**Dad: You’re my Mon Ami** 

_Son: You’re my Moan and Amy_ 

**Dad: You’re my compadre**

_Son: Dad: You’re my compadre_ 

**Dad: You’re my comrade** 

_Son: You’re my comrade_

**Dad: You’re my pal** 

_Son: You’re my pal_

**Dad: You’re my mate** 

_Son: You’re my mate_

**Dad: You’re my son**

_Son: You’re my Dad. I love you_

I don’t know when that bit stopped but I miss every second. Spend time cultivating your relationships. The reward is outstanding.

# 2+2=1
#### July 11, 2022 

Hello everyone,

It has been several weeks since I posted last. I will fill you in immediately before sharing any other thoughts. I am status quo. Nothing has really changed. The cancer has not spread for which I am grateful, but it has not diminished either. I am still doing treatments and enjoying al the perks that go with it. I will not share details as I have previously described the physical toll chemotherapy takes on the body. I still hold to my original thoughts, beats the alternative. 

I just celebrated my one year anniversary lately. Celebrate is a strong word, marked would be a better choice. It has been just over one year when we were told stage 4, no cure, limited options. I have read the reports and truthfully, I wasn’t expected to go this long but here I am 7 months after the best buy date. Yep, still thankful. The impact is still growing though. I feel up and down and I cannot control emotions some days. All normal they tell me. The wonderful thing about our system is that there are numerous options for us sick folk. I was advised on writing. I get to say things while there is still air in these lungs rather than other people saying it for me after a departure. So if you want to continue the ride with me, keep reading. If you are just looking for an update, you can stop here. I am still here and still fighting. You’re kind of stuck with me. Besides coloring was the other option and quite honestly, at coloring I stink. 

What a season so far. We were granted 4 weeks break from treatment. Kathy and went to Banff for a week. 6 days gone and 6 days of rain. Single digit temperatures too. Loved every second. We drove, we ate, we had a wonderful time. Tried to go horse back riding but they were closed. Even the horses know enough to stay out of the rain. 

What do you call it after two days of rain?  Monday. 

We have enjoyed lots of time on our little deck. So have the mosquitoes. I swear if it isn’t the vampires at the hospital taking my blood, it’s those little tiny bugs. I react to the bug bites. Think about it, I outweigh them by more than a few pounds yet their little bite cause me the discomfort. No jokes about weight please. That rollercoaster is already challenging to deal with. I am doing good now but before when I was heavy I wanted to be lighter. When the cancer made me lighter I was told I needed to be heavier. Not a big fan of irony these days. 

What is the ideal weight? Someone else’s. 

Being defined as terminal changes one perspective. Your thinking pattern changes and you become a little more reflective. I have openly shared some of my lessons, hard and easy, with you in the hope that you can take something away from me besides “dad jokes” and memories. During my period of inner examination I have faced a most challenging topic, integrity. Now some really kind people have complimented me on my reaction to this bumpy ride but they don’t see every moment. Being stoic and calm in the face of tragedy is admirable but I don’t always exercise it. Yes, during the sleepless nights and the battles with pain and the torture of treatment, I may get a little moody. And with that comes its cousins- fear, doubt anger. I try my best to CHOOSE NOT to take that path. It is difficult. As a grown adult, if I don’t want to eat my veggies then I don’t. The empress usually persuades me to change my mind but if I really didn’t want to I wouldn’t have to. (yeah right). Integrity is more than honesty. It is more than standing by your guiding morals. It is more than being able to look at yourself in the mirror every morning. 

My standards are pretty low compared to God. My most righteous acts are considered filthy rags when compared to the creator. It is impossible to live to His standards but that doesn’t mean I should settle for second best. The goal should be worthy of the attempt and there is no greater goal than pleasing God. The bible says the heavens are His throne and the earth is His footstool. He is omnipresent. So my choice is to live in the audience of one. He sees me for who and what I truly am. Every failure, every shortcoming, every anger word, every unfair judgement, every mistake. Every sin. Yet God still loves and pursues me. Failed and flawed, He chases. A defining act of love and commitment. For all those defects, He eternally waits with open arms. So folks that is what I use as a measuring stick. I try to measure every action, response and reply to being in the presence of perfect love. I won’t say it gets easier with practice either. You put 2 and 2 together and eventually and get the one right answer. 

A personal note of thanks to friends and family who continue to share our load. From cookies to grass cutting and words of love to selfless acts. To following my little preaching sessions. Thank you. I long for an end to this season but I know it is a way off. Continue to pray for us that we get through those ugly days. My purpose is to serve Him first. And second would be all of you. God bless.

> 
> Billy was extremely careful not to step on a duck. Several months went by. Then St. Peter came up to him with a gorgeous blonde and chained her to Billy, uniting them for all time. "Wow!" exclaimed Billy. "I wonder what I did to deserve this?"

# And what influences you?
#### May 18, 2022 

Hello race fans,

Well, today was meeting day with the oncologist. We had a phone meeting to discuss my progress. It has been a rough week. I was ill on Monday, that was blood test day and I felt out of it on Tuesday which was CT scan day. Most of my days can be defined by a medical function or a state of treatment. Monday is Chemo on, Wednesday is Chemo off. Wax on, wax off. Paint up, paint down. etc. Thursdays are blood donations (no receipt) and also pretzel day. Every second weekend is nap time because I spend most of it sawing logs. I have more definitions but most everyone wants to know: what’s the news? The good news is the cancer has not spread any further. The current treatments are keeping it at bay so I am quite celebratory. The not so good news is that this cancer is very aggressive and is not going to give up easily. This means my future looks exactly like my past 9 months. Relentless rounds of chemo and all the fixings. But it beats taking a permanent dirt nap. We are both a little concerned about long term nerve damage which is seeming to display itself. To try to alleviate lasting damage, the good folks on my medical team are granting me a 4 week reprieve from all treatments. I have been warned that there will be a rough week at first as my body again has to adjust to the change but overall I should benefit from a break in treatment. It is quite nice to share some good news for a change. Pessimists will not view this as a positive due to the fact that I am not really any further ahead on the path to better health but I see God’s hand in all of it. Some would describe these situations and other exercises of futility as trying to  empty the ocean with an eye dropper. I say it can be done but you just need a lot of time. I may be close to my “best before” date but until the clock stops ticking I will keep trying to move past the illness and hopefully still be of some use to others around me. I am very grateful for this platform to share my news. I guess this is my form of social media. 

Social media is a relatively new term. It wasn’t around when I was a teen or young adult. There was no faceplace, instachat or snapbook. There was gossip and a telephone line. If you were famous, there were tabloids and Entertainment Tonight (Da da da da da daaaaa). The annoying thing about this new form of communication is that fact that everyone has the ability to share what is on their tiny little minds. They spout off opinions on everything from A to Z. They post their theories about vaccinations. They spew their views on politics. I sometimes imagine they have little tin foil hats. Many of my past clients fit this mold. Social media is the mecca of the conspirers everywhere. Then others use it as a replacement for thinking. They even have to share photos of the aesthetically pleasing meals they are having, like every day. To me the bigger the meal the more I am pleased. I hate leaving hungry. A very long time ago we went out to dinner to a fancy place (ie cloth napkins) The meal was a little on the exotic side as we never prepared food like it at home. There was grand attention to details and overall, an enjoyable experience. Until the bill came. Wow. I asked the server if the decimal was in the right place. I didn’t spoil the moment by complaining. I did that after a while we were sitting in the drive thru at the arches. I mean a meal that is equivalent to a car or mortgage payment shouldn’t leave you hungry and running off to a Big Mac. I said earlier that everyone can share what is on their mind. Not everyone should be so generous. Case in point, look what you are reading. (please laugh). One of the by-products of this free for all thought festival is the birth of “influencers”. I react negatively to the term and the purpose of these people. They are at essence slaves to some corporate product or ideology that is trying to gain membership and acceptance by the use of celebrated figures. Hey the cool kids all smoke, so it must be all right. Then I thought about it for a while. Various questions arose. Is it bad to be influenced? Who influences me? Who do I influence? What am I being influenced to do?

Deep questions that have kept me awake at night. Either that or the last slice of pizza. I came down in the wee hours to address those questions, and to help your little grey cells I will give you some more to think about. First, it is not bad to be influenced or persuaded. If we never considered other points of view or were willing to try things, life would be rather dull and unsatisfactory. Think about it. Your favorite movie or book will have gone unnoticed with out a friend’s review. You may have missed out on a friendship or special bond because you ignored the guidance of another. Your favorite dessert might just be a theory if you weren’t convinced to try just a bite (it always comes back to food with me doesn’t it). So being influenced isn’t bad. It can open whole new worlds. If you are getting all you influence from say “the kardashians” then you can guarantee you are losing brain cells. The current that I am treading water in certainly can provide means for whining and complaining but God has opened many other doors for me. So being prompted and guided is not always a bad thing.

My answer for the second question is probably the same as all of you. I am influenced by family, friends and sources of trusted information. An example: My sweet wife introduced me to Crepes. The thin little breakfast treat. I love them. And the variety of servings cannot be beat. She spends huge amounts of time creating this breakfast treat. Chopping fruit, making sauces, cooking bacon, sausage, (back to food again) She stands at the stove forever to give us a wonderful meal. Before her gentle “try it”, I wasn’t to interested in skinny pancakes or omelets or whatever hybrid they are. But she influenced me for the better. One thing I take from this is to watch out for who is trying to influence me. For every crepe recipe there is one for brussel sprouts. I think the louder and more animated folk get trying to convince me, the closer they are to being wrong or totally wacko. My cancer has influenced my life. Everything I do and a lot of what I say and value is done through the filter of cancer and the eventual outcome. In many ways my life is ruled by this outside force. And most of it is unenjoyable. Yet I control its impact. I do not simply deny the existence of my problem but I choose to exercise my faith to not only overcome it but to live through it. The finish line is great but the race itself is the challenge. I am influenced by something greater than biological mis wiring. MY hope is that it truly makes me a better person, not just another “nice guy”. My life will have very little meaning if I was only known as being the nice guy.

3rd ponderance I had: Who do I influence. Wow. That is tough. I think that like it or not I vent my passions on any subject out of my yap at anytime without thought of audience. I know there are some people who are watching. My wife, my children, my neighbors, my friends. A close chum of mine suggested a movie that he honestly thought I would like. I will never get those two hours of my life back. If I were to be an influence to anyone it would be to never see this movie. I mean it was BAD. But even unaware my words and actions speak to those around me. Many of you have complimented me and encouraged me on my outlook on this bumpy road. There are many times when I am not so optimistic. It is a good thing my failures are usually behind closed doors. The frustration I get at times would not encourage anyone. It is not how I want to act or who I want to be. Again, I have to choose to believe. Faith reaches out and mercy comes running. I am reminded that the end of the road down here means a new journey begins on the other side of death. Exciting and scary but the promises I have are unbelievable. Check your bible. I am told there will be no more pain or tears. I am promised rest and joy and peace. These are things that this world cannot offer me. And if I have any influence, I want you to experience it firsthand as well. And if I get there first, maybe I will give you the tour when you arrive.

Finally, what am I being influenced to do. The world of celebrities (influencers) are trying to make me buy and use their products. They want me to act a certain way and even believe things that are vehemently opposed to my convictions. Madison avenue is motivated by the dollar. Political pundits are aroused by the power. Individuals are just craving for acceptance. God wants me to influence others so they do not miss out on what He can provide. I think that people who have been defined terminal have a unique appreciation for this. Position means nothing, wealth and possessions are meaningless. Time is our greatest commodity, and we don’t want waste it trying to be dragged to fill some pointless goal of the influencers. I hope my words and actions encourage you to greet every day with a positive outlook. I want you to be able to encourage others and help them and take reward in the joy of helping others. Many bring joy to a room. Some when they arrive and others when they leave. I hope to be in that first category. The way I try to make it happen is to be influenced by following the advice of scripture:

> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. 
> *Philippians 4:8-9*

I hope that the word of God doesn’t just influence you. I pray that it inspires you and motivates you to be more than the world of followers of some lame social media plan.

As always, thanks for following along with us. I am going to do my best to enjoy the next 4 weeks. I may even have to make a special trip out to avoid pretzel withdrawal.

# Are we there yet?
#### April 26, 2022 

Salutations all!

Today is Tuesday, I am on day 2 of my chemo treatment. I have never written mid cycle before, but I wanted to share current conditions. My numbers were a little low for a treatment schedule, not critical but low. The doctor said if I was feeling well that I could take the treatment. I wasn’t feeling too bad, so I went in for the infusions and now am on the pump. The main reason I took this route instead of a little break was an attempt to finish the process. I have been doing chemotherapy for 10 months. I have had 17 sessions averaging 2 per month with a few times where illness prevented treatment. The doctor has told me that this process can easily range up to 50-60 sessions. He has one patient who is on 80+ cycles. There is no guarantee. This is not a cure either. I will always have cancer. The purpose is to stall the spread and hopefully drive it into remission with the goal of extending my life expectancy. You may recall, the original outlook was measured at 4-6 months. Here I am 10 months later so I am claiming victory. And the credit goes to God. There is nothing I do to make this happen. No, He allows the medicine to work as it should. For some people, they do not get this measure of success. I am blessed to take the good, the bad and ugly (wha wha whaaa) of the treatments. Part of my desire to take the treatment instead of a rest was to get to the finish line a little bit sooner. Or as every child has ever asked during a trip “are we there yet?”

I took my infusion in a private room yesterday. I prefer that to the open areas. They are very busy and loud, and you do not feel rested there. I have had rooms a couple of times before and the peace and quiet helps make the process go by much easier. Yesterday’s room was new to me. It was in the very back of the floor. I think it was originally a broom closet. I mean it is small. There was room for the special chair, the medical IV pump/stand and that’s it. No room to recline the chair fully but I could stretch out my ankles.  I threw a picture on the gallery to update you. Check it out.

Yes, I look good. I didn’t say good looking, I am not that vain. But I agree with some folks who made the comment that I am looking pretty good all things considered. Weight is down but I still look like an old fat guy. My hair has started growing again. It is a different shade, no longer dark brown but a mix of brown, grey and white. I don’t care about color. It actually got me the seniors discount once. And I will never dye it. Again, I am not that vain. I think that outside of the fact that I have tubes sticking out of me and scars of the port, you can’t tell that I am sick. Overall, a good sign of progress in my battle against cancer.

Back to my urgency in getting treatment. It is not a sprint but a marathon. It looks like this will be my normal for the next year and a half plus. There are many unknow factors in play too. You cannot see around a curve. Even knowing all this, I still feel anxious about the treatment schedule in the goal of being done with it. I think it is a normal feeling. No one wants to go through dire circumstances for any length of time. I am one of those who want good news/bad news scenarios to start with the bad news. I leave the good news to last so I concentrate on that on not so much on the bad stuff. For me it is BAD NEWS: you have fatal cancer, and the only option is years’ worth of painful and life changing medical therapy. This will negatively affect almost every part of your life. GOOD NEWS: after all the efforts of treatment, the cancer is in remission, and I can live a life without pain and restrictions. Sums it up for me. How do you like to take the news? And what does the bible tell us about meeting challenges in our lives?

God tells us “Do not be anxious about anything, but by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. – Philippians 4:6-7

Easier said than done. It also says

> PROVERBS 12:25
> 
> "Anxiety leads to depression, but a good word encourages."

> MATTHEW 6:27
> 
> "Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life?"

> 1 PETER 5:7
> 
> "Throw all your anxiety onto him, because he cares about you."

> ISAIAH 41:10
> 
> "Don't fear, because I am with you; don't be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you; I will surely help you; I will hold you with my righteous strong hand."

> Psalm 94:19
> 
> When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.

There are multiple verses on the pitfalls and solutions of anxiety and worry. Fear is usually mixed in there too. Truth is, if you go searching in the bible for answers you can find them

So, my being anxious about getting treatments done when I am looking at a very long haul is quite fruitless. I share this message because I think we all have some measure of anxiety within us. Whether it be health, financial, relational etc. There is always something to fret about. When I think of worrying I think of  Matthew 6:27. I encourage you to read Jesus’ words in that passage as he teaches us about worry and anxiety. My favorite advice is Philippians 4:6-7. Again, it is instruction on teaching us how important it is to communicate with God in prayer. It is such a privilege.

Again, a big thank you and God Bless to readers and those who reply and share with us. You continue to make the journey easier.  My prayer is that anxiety does not overcome you and when it tries, these words will provide comfort.

17:22 time

> Two guys are walking through a game park & they come across a lion that has not eaten for days. The lion starts chasing the two men. They run as fast as they can and the one guy starts getting tired and decides to say a prayer, "Please turn this lion into a Christian, Lord." He looks to see if the lion is still chasing and he sees the lion on its knees. Happy to see his prayer answered, he turns around and heads towards the lion. As he comes closer to the lion, he hears the lion saying a prayer: "Thank you Lord for the food I am about to receive."

AND

> Just a reminder, today in the USA it is National Pretzel Day. I say we join the yankees and celebrate with them. They are a great prescription for anxiety, just don't look at the cost.

# C is for Cookie.......
#### April 10, 2022 

Friends, Romans, Countrymen lend me your ears

OR

Hello everybody

Monday is right around the corner and that means it is treatment time. I take issue using the word treatment. The root word in treatment is treat. What we chemos go through is hardly a treat. In fact, what we go through is quite difficult and punishing on our bodies. But then again it is discouraging enough without having to go through these doctor prescribed solutions as “punishment sessions”. As long as it is attacking the cancer cells, we can call it anything.

If you have been wondering how I have been, thanks for your concern. I have been the same. I feel ill during the treatment and it lasts about 9-10 days and then I am good for4-5 days. Good is an overstatement though. Close to normal is a better description. I mean I can function but I still am limited by what I can do. Fatigue is my worse enemy and like a fool as I keep challenging myself to “walk it off” or “rub some dirt on  it” or some other typical father first aid response. The cold dysesthesia is still just as tormenting. You can refer to past journals if you forgot that little nugget of joy.

We were put to the test this weekend. Despite best efforts, some water got into the basement and soaked the carpet and the pad. It was limited to one room and there was little other damage. But the effort to clean up seemed to need a herculean response. For a small room it held a lot of stuff. And have you  carried wet carpet lately? That small clean up and demo work pushed us to our limits. Kathy joked that it wasn’t just being sick, I am probably out of shape too. I disagree. I mean round is still a shape right? And she was joking? Right love? _Silence…_ 

Actually since this is the very tail end before treatment, I felt pretty good despite the extra workout. We had to have the hot water tank replaced. Taking a long soothing lukewarm shower just doesn’t carry that refreshing wave as actual hot water. I was quite blessed though as a friend and professional was able to do the job at a good price. I always get a kick watching other trades work. People watched me for years while I worked on their places. Kind of fun being the psychotic customer for a change. We had to do some upgrades to make it happen but it was worth it to have hot water again. But please no one tell my kids that we can have hot water longer than 5 minutes. I mean this is my chance to save $ on the water bill.

Did you catch my title? Remind you of anything or anyone. Yes, that blue fuzzy is one of my favorite actors. On that theme, lets look at the following:

C is for Cancer. I am sick of it.

C is for Chemotherapy. I am really sick of that.

C is for Covid-19. We are all really sick of that. Whether you had to suffer through the virus or not, it has been front and center for years now. We all have all been impacted one way or another. I don’t think about restrictions or mask wearing. I think about friends who aren’t with us any longer.

C is for cake. Like the one we had tonight to celebrate my firstborn’s 24th birthday. I can’t believe he is that old. I can’t believe that I am that old.

C is for colonoscopy. Let’s not go there.

C is for crazy. Like the pending weather or that guy on the bus talking to himself. When I get caught doing it, I just say I am self-employed and am having a staff meeting.

C is for car. You know, the one that needs constant repair or prayer.

C is for children. The ones that bring a lump to your throat, a tear to your eye and a pain in the ……

C is for considerate. Those people make my day.

C is for Columbo. Don’t judge me. I like the guy.

C is for candy. I likey.

C is for cucumber. I don’t.

C is for Colossians 1:13-14. _“For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.”_

C is for concern. Thank you and God bless you readers. Your concern humbles me and I bask in your warm wishes, greetings and prayers. They can beat any medicine anytime. During this season we have been blessed to see the goodness of God displayed through the words of other people.

C is for caring. This is the verb of concern here. This is where people put their words into action. Where the rubber hits the road. Where they put their money where their mouth is. You get the idea. Since I have been struck with this fatal disease, friends and friends of friends, acquaintances and even strangers have made a demonstration of their concern. Kind words, phone calls, letters, emails, and prayers have lifted me out of some very dark places. But the actions of those concerns have placed us in an even  higher place. We are so grateful for those little things. Someone brought lunch, someone made cookies, another helped flood proof my iceberg flooded yard. Some really wonderful saints shovelled my driveway. Someone brought coffee. So many have reached out. Some have come just to pray.  Even the smallest things have made a big impact. They do not go unnoticed. Even the anonymous actions have been watched by God. I pray a special blessing on all of you. When I look back at the last 9 months I get a little teary eyed. I hardly think that I deserve all this attention but there it is, just blessing me. Where we have lost in one aspect, God has provided abundantly in another.

C is communication. I have rather a failing grade on this aspect. I make a few attempts to express my gratitude for the kindness thrown my way. I can offer many excuses but that is all they are, excuses and not reasons. So please know your words are not lost or ignored. I have a lot on my mind and I am just meditating on them.

Thank you everyone. I really cannot describe the impact your love in action has had. God has shown me incredible truths that I was too blind to see. You have been His teaching tools.

Yeah, that’s right. My friends are a bunch of tools.

Today's ramblings have been brought to you by the letter  C and the number, oh let's say 4. 

17:22 time

> My wife says I have two faults. I don’t listen and something something something.
> 
> Don’t tick off a terminally ill person. Life in prison doesn’t mean much.

# And what's new with you?
#### March 13, 2022 

Hello racers,

Well, to get to the point. I am going in for a chemo session tomorrow Monday the 14th. I will be receiving another new medication. The last one certainly gave me quite a run. The new meds are designed to attack the tumors that have hit my pancreas. They gave me fair warning that it would be difficult to handle, and the new side effects are quite unpleasant. More or less, my journey was only getting rougher.

Cold dysesthesia is the newest treat I get to endure. It is a super sensitivity to cold. They warned me that I would be very adverse to anything cold. I would be best off to wear hat and gloves inside and stay bundled up and warm as possible. I thought “how bad can it be?” I was raised here after all, the birth place and true definition of cold. Then reality hit when I took a sip of cool water. It felt like my face exploded. My upper lip was burning and tingling and freezing at the same time. It was like French kissing dry ice. Another grim example was when I had to let our dog out to do her business. I opened the storm door and my fingers felt electrocuted. The feeling went way beyond just the contact points where I touched the door handle. The feeling can apparently last for hours up to days. The other joy I get to look forward to is the loss of feeling in my hand and feet. Yes, medicine is quite complex. Seems for every good there is something bad. They warned me that I would feel quite fatigued. I already suffer that I replied. Their response was “not like this”. They were right. I spent more time asleep than awake. I have said before there is very little dignity inbeing ill. The poking and prodding, the wonderful attire, the endless round of tests and such. My newest delight is having to provide for a urine test every time I give blood. This is so they can accurately give me a proper dose of my poison. I just feel uncomfortable walking around having to carry my own waste. Ugh. And things are so busy, it is hard to be discreet. Oh well, keeps me humble. Anyone want to trade places?

So you may be wondering what insight I have to share. God has certainly provided some wisdom and great object lessons since I have started this journey. Well today I got nothing. No, there has been no great experience, no grand intervention, no revelation or insights or significant insights. Things have been dull and quiet. It is true that last round was hard to endure. I was in a great deal amount of pain, the new side effects took their toll on my body. I slept a lot but never really felt rested. During this week, we didn’t hear from anyone or go anywhere or make contact beyond the walls of the house. There was a breaking point where I asked me better half to contact our small group and let them know what was going on. They instantly replied with prayers and well wishes. As time dragged on, and I mean dragged, my body began to feel better. My mood however was going downhill. I was getting anxious about this round starting tomorrow. I only began to think about the discomfort and the pain. I lay awake at night dreading the infusion. Every spare thought seemed to go the uncomfortable sentence of carrying the pump around. I was getting down.

But then I got an email from a friend with encouraging words. I was texted by another reminding me that I was in his thoughts and he was praying for me. I got phone calls of similar intent and purpose. Then we were given an invite for dinner and someone else provided a delicious meal on another night. More emails, more texts. All of them incredible examples of words into deeds. Each one has given me more strength and encouragement. I spent most of the day sleeping but I was truly getting rest. I feel a great deal of peace that only God can supply but it was sent by friends and family. I believe it happened when I needed it, not when I wanted it. I am not looking forward to tomorrow but I now feel I will be able to handle it because I have been reminded that I am not alone. SO a big God Bless to all of you. Not just those who have reached out but everyone who reads my rambling and everyone who offers up a quick prayer. They never go unheard and I pray for a blessing on all you, my support team. Thank you just doesn’t seem to do it justice but we are so appreciative. Like I said, nothing happened lately, or did it?

Love to all

Dale

# I’ve got good news and bad news
#### February 17, 2022. 

Hello listeners,  
  
It is Thursday. The day after Wednesday. Pretty sure that is still how it works. I have a very simple and short message to everyone tonight. Just the latest update on our struggle against my cancer. I make mention the day because it is typical that I meet with the oncology team on Wednesday after I do a round and we discuss progress. I can blame chemo fog but it has been a little harder keeping track of things lately. Last week there was infusion on Monday and carry the chemo pump until Wednesday. Thursday was a visit to x-ray clinic. Friday was field trip to lab for blood work. Monday I won the prize and got to have another CT scan. Tuesday was another blood work day. We have complications with that too. I think they are going to the well too often but they solved the issue without my help. Wednesday was a 2 for 1 special: my annual physical first thing in the morning followed by that meeting with the specialist. Now you may think that seems to be a lot of medically related visits, and I agree, it was.  
  
The physical was typical with the wonderful exception of missing the old prostate check. After all we had a nuclear polaroid that measured everything so there was no need for the doctor to go mining in a cave that should only operate in one direction. I have been “examined” every year since I turned 40. Haven’t enjoyed it once. Just wish she wasn’t so enthusiastic about it. It is like trying to get the last pickle in the jar. You notice I said she. Yes, my family doctor is a woman and a choice I made quite purposefully. You see, she has small dainty fingers. My previous doctor had hands the size of a toilet seat and you would swear a lumberjack had more graceful and delicate digits. I cannot think of better criteria for picking a doctor than that, can you? I guess manner, professionalism, knowledge and the like may have contributed but really I was measuring out how much damage she could do. No problems but like I said, I have never enjoyed it. Not once. Not ever. She did give me updates as compared to last physical and is fully aware of the cancer battle. We focussed on the good news. My weight was very good, my breathing is better and my cholesterol levels were fantastic. We finished with a small procedure and some follow up arrangements. I was quite happy.  
  
Then the meeting with the cancer squad.(sigh. Big sigh. Huge, long, drawn out, depressing sigh). My cancer has spread. In addition to lungs, liver, lymph nodes and bowels, it has decided to take residency in my pancreas. Just what I need-another tumour. I mean enough is enough. Well this development means a change in plans. We are trying new chemo drugs and have signed up for another surgical procedure. My good doctor again provides the info and offers me choice and I am grateful we still are pursuing treatment options though I can begin to understand why some people begin to give up. They lack hope. I used to believe the most precious commodity was not money but time. Everyone I knew wish they had more time. They would use it to complete things and then use the extra time to enjoy something. But in my opinion, time is secondary now to hope. We all have time. We all have the same amount, we just manage it differently. Some do it well and others…eh. But hope is a real commodity. It is my faith that keeps the engine running. My confidence in a higher power that gets me through the rough days and nights. Hope is the spark that keeps that fire. I think if we lose hope we truly lose everything. Hope is partnered with faith and love. I may have mentioned that before. I have chosen “hope” as my title page on this site. I think that as long as people are praying, God is listening and there is hope. Thank you for keeping hope with me. it is my wish that one day I can reciprocate and encourage you too.

love you all

# Sticks and Stones
#### January 21, 2022 

Hello Movers and Shakers,

I hope everyone has started 2022 on a good note. Ours was very noneventful. Like all of you we have been just trudging through the confines of winter. I have grown weary of the cold and the snow. No offense to the sled heads and other frigid fans but I long for days of warm sunshine, green grass and bright blue skies. Good news is that I know it’s coming.

I have done one complete chemo session and will be starting another one on Monday. So hard to get motivated for what lies ahead. The last round seemed to go on forever. I felt ill the entire time. All the side effects have come back: fatigue, chemo fog, hair loss etc. I have also struggled with pain management too. There are times when the pills just don’t cut it. And then there are the wonderful, marvellous, fantastic, beautiful times when they work their magic, and all is right in the world. They also might be the times that I accidentally double dose though.

Christmas was a good time for us as we were able to visit and share a bit with friends and family. Covid rules obviously kept us all limited, but I so appreciated what we had. It is unfortunate that relationships suffer so much during this time. If I haven’t said it lately, thanks to all who keep tabs on us while we walk our Cancer path. Words cannot communicate how we feel. Well they can, but we just haven’t been able to adequately do the job right.

I don’t go out much. When I do have to leave my comfy castle and deal with the dark cruel world, I am like you and wear a mask. Not only is it a legal requirement but also a courtesy for those that I must deal with. I want to take every precaution, so I do not get sick and likewise I do not wish to be a transmitter of the virus. Fortunately, most of us follow suit when it comes to masks. I find it interesting how much we rely on non verbal communication during this time. Masks obliviate any interpretation of facial expressions and sometimes we do not leave with an accurate picture or mood of the conversation. Case in point: I had to go to Service Canada with paperwork to submit. The clerk I dealt with seemed to be very rigid and only mechanically polite. He was thoroughly double checking the plethora of questions and answers that were on the forms. He was wearing a mask and I could only see his eyes very well. I felt that he was scowling as he reviewed my application. I sat there and felt as if he was unfairly judging me for having to beg the system for financial support. I was beginning to get annoyed having to deal with this emotionless robot. Then he stopped after a half dozen pages and put them down and he looked straight at me. He told me his mother had the same cancers that I have. He struggled with his words but shared that with treatments, she was able to live another 20 years with her family. He gave a weak fist pump and said to ‘keep going’. Then he picked up the papers and finished reviewing them within another five minutes. We reviewed things and made corrections and concluded our business and as we parted he offered another mild fist pump and told me with a cracked voice to keep my hope up. Again, I only saw his eyes but I am sure they were moist with tears. The mask kept me from making an accurate judgement of this helpful clerk. He was sincere and caring and I was dead wrong.

Next day I was at a medical appointment. I had to line up to pass through the screening check in. I have done it dozens of times and it is only a mild inconvenience. Not everyone sees it that way. There was an older gentleman in line who was pacing as he waited. He muttered under his breath and acted with very jerky, sporadic movements. He was obviously angry and everyone in the room knew it when it was his turn to be screened. He was loud and rude. I felt so sorry for the poor girl as she had to stand up to this aggressive bully and his unjust whining. I was ready to stand in and intercede but within a minute she had calmed the old relic down and he was quietly taking her directions. I guess she not only had good training but lots of practice. The old man was obvious with his body language that he was full of anger. His attitude was easy to identify due to his actions. Although physical actions and gestures say a lot, it is our words that actually communicate our message.

Words hurt and words heal. They can be familiar phrases or freshly created expressions. Words are powerful and we should all be careful not only in how we use them but how we interpret them. The use of masks or the separation due to a physical barrier can impede the interpretation of our words. Who hasn’t been left wondering about a person’s mood after reading a text or email. You cannot measure tone or attitude through written words. For an example, my dear wife may call me a melonhead. I am sure she doesn’t but if she does, it with a small chuckle and a smile on her lips. If you were just reading a text of our conversation, you would think she was just being a big meanie. In the 3rd chapter of James, Jesus’ half brother discusses the importance of words. He states the tongue is a small part of the body yet makes great boasts. He compared the use of our words to the small spark that causes a forest fire, a small bit in the mouth that controls the animal and even how the small rudder steers a great ship. Yes, words have power. The book of Proverbs is a collection of God inspired sayings and messages to teach the reader important truths regarding life. These are just a small sampling of what it conveys about the power of speech:

- _“A gentle answer turns away wrath, but hard words stir up anger” Prov 15:1_ 

- _“Gentle words bring life and health; a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit” Prov 15:4_ 

- _“Kind words are like honey-sweet to the soul and healthy for the body” Prov 16:24_ 

- _“A person’s words can be life giving water, words of true wisdom are as refreshing as a bubbling brook” Prov 18:4_ 

- _“Words satisfy the soul as food satisfies the stomach; the right words on a person’s lips bring satisfaction” Prov 18:20_ 

- _“Wise speech is rarer and more valuable than gold and rubies” Prov 20:15_

Words are critical in communication. As I said earlier, it is important not only how to use them but also interpret them. Listening is a harder skill to master than speaking. I think that is why God gave us two ears and only one mouth.  We need to listen more than we speak. (ouch or amen). And when we do speak, let it be  those valuable words that scripture describe as healthy and life giving. There are many times when words have escaped my big yap and I wish nothing more than to get them back. But once they are out there, they are there forever. If positive words can build then negative words can destroy. I pray for everyone who carries a wound from destructive words from the past that they be released from the pain and burden of them. Whether it be accurate or not, the pain is very real and I believe we all have an experience like that. I hope you find the peace that I have found. I haven’t forgotten the pain inflicted venom that was aimed at me BUT I found the secret to overcoming it. If you want to know, you’ll have to ask me one day😊

So everyone, as we struggle through mask season, our communication is subject to risk. There are times where it helps to see words impacted with a physical gesture. And facial expressions can greatly enforce a person’s words (ever see a child eat brussel sprouts?) But let us be careful using our words. Sometimes to make yourself clear it is worth saying twice. Or to paraphrase, you may need to say something twice to make your message clear.

Ponderings from this week:

- Why did my dog’s teeth cleaning cost more than my recent oral surgery?

- Why did the city just clear my quiet dead end bay down to the cement while it was still snowing?

- Why do I have more paperwork to fill out only to make less money?

- How come “fat chance” and” slim chance” mean the same thing?

17:22 time (this happened this week)

> It finally happened. I knew it would happen one day, but I didn’t expect it this week. I mean how does one prepare for such a thing. I was totally surprised too. It caught me off guard and I wasn’t ready, so my answers were off the cuff and spontaneous. I replayed the moment in my mind over and over all evening. How could this of happened? Will it happen again? After the shock I was bothered and wondered “has this ever happened to any of my friends? I mean it wasn’t my fault. You can’t control this kind of thing. Someone assumed and then it just happens. I know that I am not the only one but still it happens and you feel strange. Life just will not be the same again. Feelings are hurt, egos are wounded and things are no longer normal. I was at the grocery store and they automatically gave me the seniors discount. No questions asked. I can only blame so much on being sick. Still 10% off is better than nothing. But Seniors? Really? Ouch.

# Do not open till Christmas!
#### December 17, 2021

Hello Shoppers,

Christmas has come a little early for me. My good doctor and I have agreed to delay treatment for another a week. This way I can enjoy the holidays and everything they offer. Food and fellowship and all the trimmings. It also gives my white blood cells an opportunity to recover to a better level. They are a bit on the low side and that makes treatment difficult and hard to go through. So, I get a little break and anytime I can get away from the discomforts of being cured is a bonus.

I am really in a festive mood this year. It probably stems from the fact that this was supposed to be my last Christmas and so far, it looks like the treatment plan is working so hoping that is just another medical guess I can prove wrong. I have a lot to be jolly about. I didn’t start my day with this outlook. On the contrary, I was grumpy. Irritable even. Some would even say grouchy. I didn’t want anything to do with Christmas joy and the like. But then some joy came. And it wasn’t even for the fact it was pretzel day.

The feeling was solidified today while I was at the hospital for routine blood work. There were limited places to sit due to Covid restrictions and I wound up sitting next to a child patient. She was bout 10 years old. I had seen her before during my multiple visits. She was practically bald with very few hairs left. I guess she normally had long dark hair. There were dark rings under her eyes and her cheeks were sunken. She had a tube running up to her nostrils and another set of tubes running to a pick line. She was very under weight and looked quite boney. She was beautiful. She sat there with her mother who also looked tired and worn. Mom had made the attempts to look nice, but her hair looked odd and even her makeup seemed to be out of place. And this is being observed from a man’s perspective.

Then I heard her. I had missed the first verse but easily identified her tune from the start of the second.

**_Little baby…Pa rum pum pum pum  
I am a poor boy too…Pa rum pum pum pum_**

 She was singing as she sat there coloring. You see that is one of the options they encourage all patients to perform at Cancer Care. You can either create a journal or do some coloring. I took the writing route as I explained in my last posting. I was never good at coloring. I couldn’t stay in the lines.

 **_I have no gift to bring…Pa rum pum pum pum  
That's fit to give our king…Pa rum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum_**

 She was coloring a Christmas tree. And she stayed in the lines. I was so jealous. She sang so quietly, and I am not even sure the others in the room even heard her. I watched her intently as her lips moved. Despite all appearances she seemed to be quite… happy. I am sure she suffers from the pain of cancer. I am sure there are many nights when she is ill in the bathroom and crying for her mom to come to bring comfort, but it doesn’t come. I am sure she has felt the stares from strangers or even have heard someone verbalize “such a pity”. I am certain she is confused and full of fear as all she understands is the unending number of needles and pills and trips downtown.

 **_Shall I play for you…Pa rum pum pum pum  
on my drum_**

 It was silent. I was deep in my thoughts and hadn’t noticed that she had stopped singing. Now she was staring at me. Her eyes ere wide open and her head tilted slightly. I looked at her then her mother and smiled politely but her gaze was locked onto me. Time stood still. The moment was becoming awkward.

 **_Mary nodded…Pa rum pum pum pum_**

 The singing resumed but it was different.

**_The ox and lamb kept time…Pa rum pum pum pum_**

 The voice was low and gravelly. It was not in tune. It sounded like a wounded animal. It was bad. It was terrible. It was… me.

 **_I played my drum for him…Pa rum pum pum pum_**

 Mercifully, she had joined me in singing. With her slight hand movements she was trying to direct me. I looked around and people were watching. Probably looking to relocate seats.

**_I played my best for him…Pa rum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum_**

 At that moment, I meant the words like never before.

 **_Then he smiled at me…Pa rum pum pum pum  
Me and my drum_**

 She continued to stare and then after a bit she returned her focus onto her coloring. No one seemed to have noticed our little impromptu caroling. I was about to say something when a nurse came over and spoke to them and said “OK, Joy we are ready for you”. Oh come on! Her name was Joy. I started looking for cameras and microphones. This hallmark moment couldn’t be real.

 It wasn’t. Really? Me singing any where would be miraculous let alone in a group of strangers. There are some aspects of truth in my little tale. There are children suffering through cancer as well as adults. We tend to have more sympathy for them as their innocence should preclude them from this type of suffering. And just like me, people can have a change of heart.

 This season is filled with it. There are songs, stories, tv shows, movies and even plays all about it. There is a theme that goes with Christmas and I hope most of you recognize it. You can ask Ebeneezer Scrooge or that mean one, Mr Grinch. Redemption. I love the stories of redemption as they can bring you one of the rarest commodities, hope. There are dozens of versions of Dickens “a Christmas Carol”. The best one I have ever seen, the one with raw emotion, superb acting, incredible directing and true story telling skill is “the Muppets Christmas Carol.” That frog deserved an Oscar. Second chances are wonderful, and we all have needed them. God’s grace is an unlimited supply of second chances. Why is it that we sometimes need a catastrophe to realize it. I said in my second paragraph that I have a lot to be jolly about. I am alive after all. During my run with cancer I have learned many things and changed my attitude more than once. Terminal illness certainly helps you to put things in perspective. After all the small stuff is really just small stuff.

 God will use any path possible to show you this. The bible says in 1 Corinthians 1:27 “But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong” That is what we need sometimes: to be put in our place by weak stupid people.

 This will be my last posting for a while. I will share as I feel led to. Consider it a break readers, you deserve it. Thank you to everyone who walks with us, prays with us and makes effort to share our burden. You are a blessing. I pray for an incredible Christmas for you and hopefully we can have the opportunity to meet face to face very soon.

 **17:22 time Double shot**

> 
> “it was okay” said the farmer “but if only one cow shows up at feeding time, I don’t drop the full load on it”

Merry Christmas everyone. And a happy 2022. I hope that I have many more opportunities to share with you. In all the lessons learned this year, the recurring message is to trust God and His plan. Not mine. And we all said…. AMEN.

# My humble contribution
#### December 6, 2021 

Hello travellers,

I have been asked why I do this journal. Our intention was to use this site to share the news and updates of my cancer. It was to provide anyone who was concerned, the latest update so that I could excuse myself from having to contact all our friends, family and even acquaintances. It took over a week to first notify everyone I was sick and even then, I had unintentionally missed people. It was a difficult and emotionally draining task. If you read them from the beginning, you will see that they evolved on their own as I began to share not only my experiences but also lessons, I have been learning. The writing became cathartic for me. Yes, it may be preachy and religious but it is sincere. I try to be as open and honest as I can. Why? It is probable that my time may be limited so my aim is to encourage, challenge, inspire or even entertain you. I want to make a difference and contribute rather than sit and sulk at my problems. If you are not learning from your experiences, you are missing out. I will try to put the medical updates at the front of my ravings. And if you are not a fan of the rest of it, feel free to not read it.

I believe it was the great contemporary philosopher Garfield who coined the phrase “I hate Mondays”.

I concur with the fat orange one on this matter, well at least every second Monday. You see every second Monday, I scurry down to Cancer Care Manitoba at the HSC and receive my Chemotherapy treatment. It is a couple hours in the infusion chair and then I have to carry a pump around for three days while it continues to make me sick administer medication. I have this routine for another 10 weeks. Yay. Then it is a battery of tests to determine our progress. Today is one of those days. 

Again, thank you friends for your care and concern regarding my health. My journey is so much easier with you. A special thank you to those who put their words into action. Those displays of love not only bless Kathy and I but excite our faith too. We see people trying make a difference firsthand and since I am the focus of those efforts, I am blown away. 

It is a humbling experience to have to go through the very invasive medical procedures that cancer treatments provide. Most of my visits to the hospital typically involve wearing a gown. I think that gown is a generous word. To me, a gown is glamorous, fancy, sparkly and attractive, not that I want to wear one (it would make my butt look big). I am thinking a gown like wedding (not bridesmaid) or beauty pageant. Hospital gowns are the complete opposite. They have the consistency of a paper bag, have some serious exposure risks, pretty bland colours and usually open from the back. On top of it all they are supposed to secure with a couple of shoelaces at the back that only a contortionist may be able to reach. 

Getting ill (vomiting) is also humbling. It goes together with Chemo like peas and carrots. Ugh, just had a shudder and vision of orange and green. Most people cannot control when they are going to throw up. It is the worst of feelings. Not only can it be sudden but it can also last for hours. Usually a flu symptom, we can all relate to sharing some time with the commode outside of its intended design. The relief of a session passing is worth setting off fireworks but the fear of a sequel restrains us well. I remember as a child getting sick on an amusement park ride (Tilt-a-World). This may have been assisted by the 17 tacos I had for lunch. I still pity my fellow riders. After they hosed me off I couldn’t look them in the eye. Even when I wasn’t sick, vomit was out to take me down a notch. I remember lying beside my little girl when she sick. I was there to help her, to comfort her. We finished bedtime prayers and I was next to her on the bed talking. Then she threw up. I watched it in slow motion. It went straight up, levitated for a second or two, moved over to me by 3 inches and then succumbed to gravity. Hard to maintain composure when you are covered in partially digested Pogos and potato chips.

Being humble is a good thing. Getting humbled is not. I have been in this situation more than once. I have also had to eat my words several times. It has happened so often that I have had athlete’s tongue from sticking my foot in my mouth so often. Scripture exhorts us to be of the same mind set of Jesus, who in very being nature is God, humbled himself like a servant. The eternal creator of the universe, the king of kings, humbled himself to the limits of man including death. So amazing. Humility is a great attribute. No one wants to spend time with a proud person, full of themselves, arrogant. No, we are drawn to the quiet power of humility. I have learned it is better to practice it yourself before someone or something imposes it on you.  
  
After all “pride cometh before a fall” And 1st Peter 5 says “ All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time."

I appreciate people who demonstrate their special talents or abilities while maintaining a sense of humility. The relationship can be ruined if the person is boastful. Even if you are the best at something, records are there to be challenged and broken. So my prayer is that we all exercise humility before it just happens to us.


Worth thinking about: 

The penguin population on the Falkland Islands is 692,473. I know cause I counted. During the Falkland War in 1982, the British deployed their high tech fighter jets to the area in an attempt to intimidate the Argentinian armed forces but it had a strange effect on the flightless waterfowl population.

As the jets flew from east to west, 692,473 penguins stood totally still and only moved their heads from left to right tracking the jets until they were gone

Like wise when the jets did a flyover from west to east 692,473 penguins stood totally still and only moved their heads from right to left tracking the jets until they were gone.

Then as the fighter jets flew from north to south, 692,473 penguins stood totally still and just kept lifting their heads as the fighter flew over and not turning around they kept lifting their heads until they fell over on their backside. Then you had 692,473 penguins lying on their backs looking at the sky. 

The moral: even if 692,473 people do a stupid thing, it remains a stupid thing. And nothing is quite humbling as doing a stupid thing.



17:22 Time 

Please note that this has no reference or similarity to my own pastor. 

> A little boy and a minster bumped into each other in the foyer after a church service 
> 
> Little Boy: When I grow up, I am going to give you some money. 
> 
> Pastor: Well! That is very nice of you. What makes you want to do that? 
> 
> Little Boy: Daddy says you’re the poorest preacher he’s ever heard.

Love you all. God bless.

# The sequel begins
#### November 20, 2021 

Hello travelers,  
  
It is time for an update to all those who take an interest on our current journey. The Port procedure went quite well. I have already done one blood test and find it less obtrusive than that nasty Pick line. With the new device and my schedule, I will not have to suffer additional appointments for pick maintenance. Did a quick calculation and figured I have had my arm wrapped in bandages for 4 months solid. Once I had it removed and went home, I had a 20 minute scratch. AAAAHHHHHH!  
  
On Monday I begin round 2 of the chemo treatments. That means another 12 weeks of cycling on and off the medication. Pity because my hair was just beginning to come back. I have also put on some healthy weight too. Those bonuses will disappear quickly. The good news is Christmas falls in between treatment sessions. Hopefully during this round I can recover faster. The docs are determined to make improvements and make my quality of life better.   
  
On that subject, life isn't so bad. Since my last posting I have spent the time reading books (dozens) and indulging in some hobby work. I have been blessed to spend time with friends and family. I have had amazing people send emails and letters (remember those?), provide dinner, meet for coffee and even clean my driveway after that ugly dumping of snow. God has placed incredible people around us at the worst time of our life. With Covid causing separation and division, God has made sure to fill the void and meet all our needs. And we are far from over. I still have several people yet to connect with and it does wonders to lift the burdens from my illness. If people can say anything about me, it is that I pick amazing friends. Well, God helped with that too. I am so grateful. You know who you are, and with everything in me,  I say thank you.  
  
In case anyone missed the posting, I responded real well to the first round of treatments. All the tumors and nodules shrank a certain amount. It is hard to quantify but under one measurement, I dropped an astounding amount but a different way showed less change. It was still a drop so I will gladly take it. The docs have hinted that I may be looking at 50-60 treatments and even then there is no guarantee. That was a bit discouraging. Hard enough to look forward one treatment, let alone dozens. I just have to remind myself that I gave this to God and it is in His hands. I have to learn to stop trying to take it back.  
  
What a picture that gives us. As parents we spent many hours trying to teach our children life skills. How to use cutlery, how to tie their shoes, cutting with scissors, printing (forget about writing. That is now as common as hieroglyphics). We taught them how to ride their bikes, make toast, math, english, history, science. If you have boys, we had to teach them how to aim. There was a reason a Lysol bottle and wipes lived on the tank for 6 years straight. (parents of only girls can ask me later)  As children they were always anxious to take over as soon as they could. As adults we knew better. We had more experience, wisdom, patience and motor skills to do the task correctly. Where they lacked, we were in abundance.  Even their best attempts sometimes looked like a car wreck. But we were so proud. I dare you to find me any mother in the world that doesn't have at least one piece of gold painted macaroni art or similar.  
  
That is how we act sometimes with God. We take Him our problems. We go to the cross and leave our burdens and leave refreshed energized and able to move forward. It doesn't mean that the problem is gone. It just means someone stronger is helping carry it. But like little children, we want to take it back. We lack patience or understanding or sometimes we are just stubborn. You can respond with an amen or an ouch.  Just as children do not always understand the reasoning behind an action or words, we act that ways toward God. We are so self focused, we neglect to see the benefit of giving the burden to someone else.

If it isn't doubt, fear, or impatience the other challenge is strength. We tire out. I tire out quite easily these days. I get winded chasing a thought. Seriously, either the meds or the cancer drains me of most of my energy.  Many times the pain keeps me awake at night and that adds to the problem. Sometimes I get tired so quickly, I give up my task. It is not just physical but intellectual and emotional too. I even give up trying to solve the riddle on my cereal box.  Again it is similar to being with small children. How often has a walk turned into a ride. Not a father or mother ever avoided those words "Carry me!".  And we did.  It didn't matter that we walked the same distance, we were stronger. So it is with God. And unlike the tuckered out parent, He is always willing.

This verse has spoken to me more than once:

> “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." Matthew 11:28

So friends, when you are having one of those days, recall this verse and take it to action. Take it to God and for goodness sake, leave it there. Don't try to take back the problem and deal with it on your own. God has said it is all right for you to call out "carry me".

Prov 17:22

I hope this spoken joke translates into written word.

> A fellow gets bit by the fishing bug and gets committed to his new found hobby. He was looking down one day, a friend asked why he was glum and he replied that now that winter is here, he missed his time fishing. Being a good friend , he pointed out the whole new world of ice fishing. Our fellow was thoroughly excited and charged out the next day to confirm the existence of ice fishing.
> 
> He got to the ice and carefully selected a spot. He drew out a hole. He dug and dug and after a small eternity, he saw some water in the bottom of his ice hole. More digging, cleaning and then finally... open water. Just as he was about to drop his line in, a voice boomed all around him. "THERE ARE NO FISH THERE". Our fellow looked around but there was not a soul to be seen. 
> 
> Not willing to give up, he packed up all his stuff and moved over a fair piece and started another hole. IT was the same process all over again. Dig and clean, dig and clean. He began to get tired but success! he found water. Just as he was about to lower his line the voice thundered "THERE ARE NO FISH THERE"
> 
> Our fellow didn't give up. In fact he tried again and again and again. He was exhausted and frustrated. He was on the last hole and he looked around him at the ice. It was full of holes and looked like swiss cheese. Just as he was lowering his line the mysterious voices cried out and echoed  "THERE ARE NO FISH THERE".
> 
> He looked about and he was still alone. He had a revelation. He cried out "Is this God?"
> 
> Silence. Then the voice filled the air "NO. THIS IS THE ARENA ANNOUNCER"

Please remember me this week. Love to all.

Dale out.

# Scary stuff
#### October 31, 2021 

It was on July 9th of this year that the first tangible evidence of my cancer treatment showed itself. I had a Pick line installed on my left arm. I left a long and witty commentary on the procedure. I believe it went something  like "Ouch"  
  
A Pick line is a catheter tube that enters a vein along my left bicep and the tube then goes up to my shoulder, across my chest and then ends just over my heart. (yes they found one). The pick has been there since early summer. The purpose of the device is to avoid the constant injections from blood tests and medicine administration. Blood work has been every 2 weeks and there have been several times where I had to go weekly. Even this past week I had to give blood twice. A guy only has so much to give. The pick also allows for easier administration of the chemo meds. That would have been 12 more injections. Needless to say the Pick line is a handy little thing. Of course there is a down side. It is unnatural to have this thing attached to me. I can get used to it but it doesn't take much to notice it again. It is very limiting on what you can do. I cannot lift anything heavy. I cannot wear certain shirts as they snag on it or get too tight. I cannot get it wet whatsoever, so it limits the shower schedule. In short it is a pain in the uh...arm.

Tomorrow, they remove the device and install a Port. This is essentially the same tool. It avoids multiple injections and allows for easier treatment. The port is installed in my chest just under the collar bone. It is about the size of a looney and is a simple surgical procedure. So out with the old and in with the new. Please remember me while I undergo this procedure. I don't want the doc to make a mistake and install it somewhere else like my head. I mean there would go all my  brain juice. 

The port has several advantages over the pick. A big one is the reduction of the dressing changes. The pick was weekly. I am not sure but I believe the port will be monthly. This will bring about some relief to my van as it almost knows how to go to the hospital on its own. Again I say lets hear it for progress. I have said that i want to put small LED lights around it and I can look like Iron Man. Again with the lack of heart issue, I may be closer to being the Tin Man.

> It is Halloween night. I am sitting in my living room with lights out and the blinds closed. Why? I don't have candy to hand out. I don't have chips. I don't have pop or licorice or rockets or nerds or even granola bars. (you know who you are) Its not like I am opposed to treating the kids to a sweet or two. Its just that I think numbers will be very low and I am too lazy to get up off the couch. How's that for honesty? Truth be told, I did purchase some treat boxes over the last couple of weeks. These seem to have immigrated to parts unknow but I have found all sorts of wrappers in the waste basket of my kids and she-who-should-not-be-named. I suspect the empress is exercising some buyer's right to sample.
> 
> While I am on the subject, doesn't the candy selection seem very limited? It appeared to me that there less than half dozen choices at old stuffmart. The biggest change was the size, the minis are getting smaller. AND while i am at it, why do they always have one sucky type of candy in those boxes. They outnumber the good ones like 5 to 1. Does anyone really like smarties that much? Crispy Crunch? 
> 
> I would expound more on the subject but I just remembered a certain hiding spot for forbidden chocolate treats. I may run out tomorrow and see what I can buy on clearance. What a boo-tiful idea.

# The verdict is in.....
#### October 27, 2021

Greetings citizens,  
  
A great big thank you to everyone who is anxious for the news after today’s meeting with the oncologist. Your thoughts, well wishes, prayers and tokens of love and appreciation have often been the much needed fuel that we have needed to face this burden over the last 5 months.  
  
So, the verdict. I have cancer. Lots. As I reported before it is in and on my lung, liver, bowels etc. I have spent the last 16 weeks undergoing a chemotherapy plan to halt the spread of the cancer cells and hopefully to reduce and remove it. The good news is that I took well to the treatments and there has been a significant reduction in the number and size of my nodules and tumours. I feel very good today not just about the news but physically too. It is a great contrast to the initial news which had me originally pegged for worm food in the boneyard. My cancer has shrunk. Thank you God!  
  
The downside is that it is not gone. I am getting a short break and then starting treatments again. Not going to lose momentum now that we have started to turn the tide. The good doctor is going put me through another 12 week session and we will redo the tests and again see where we are at. The options are limited and the possible outcomes are multiple. He is confident that we are on the right path for treatment. We are going to experiment with some drug levels and timelines. His concern is to increase my quality of life while sitting on the clock trying to beat this. Currently I am 9 days “under the weather” and 5 days feelin’ fine. Our hope is to drastically lower the cloudy days and increase the good. BUT, nothing is promised. I must be extra cautious this season not to catch a bug. I will still spend several _minutes, hours, days,_ weeks feeling all the discomforts that the modern cure will provide me. It was explained to me that all this progress is a reason to be glad and celebrate. It doesn’t change the fact that the road in front me isn’t filled with potholes(Winnipeg analogy). It may get even bumpier but overall it looks good.  
  
Let us be clear on this right away. I have not beaten cancer. I have done nothing to further my personal health. The doctors played their small part. The nurses have done an incredible job (if you see one thank them). The medicine did a lot and will hopefully do more. Credit goes to God. The universe sits in the palm of His hand. Tides rise and fall at His will. The planets dance their heavenly number according to His wish. Scripture tells us that He knows the very number of hairs on your head. If He is able to control all that, why would I think that this was a problem He couldn’t solve. He is able. He is willing. He has a plan. I serve Him and not the other way around. So with faith, I will continue this journey. Pray that I still be willing to learn what He wants to teach me. Pray that His will be done. Pray that we all grow closer to Him. Now is the time seek Him. Tomorrow may not come. Seize the day.  
  
I will continue to write my little musings on this site so if you are inclined to hear what my little grey cells are playing, please feel free to follow along. Frequency and topic may be sporadic and change often but this still the best method for us to share with all our family and friends. It will be our first source should there be any urgency or sudden need. And as always, both Kathy and I want to pray for you. To come along beside you and share your burden. Keep praying for us also as our path has been set before us. The good news is that we do not walk it alone. Never have.  
  
Be glad to share with anybody at anytime. God bless.  
  
17:22 some random thinkings  
  
> If you could talk to one person living or dead, who would it be?  
> 
> That’s easy... the living one.  
  
  
OK, pick a number between 2 and 5  
  
multiply by 9  
  
add the two digit answer together (36 = 3+6) =9  
  
subtract 5  
  
Take that number and find it’s place in the alphabet (1=a, 2=b, 3=c, etc)  
  
name a country that starts with that letter.  
  
take the last letter of that country and name an animal that starts with the same letter  
  
take the last letter of the animal and name a Color that starts with the same letter.  
  
That was a lot of leg work to try a little experiment. If it works you all should arrive at the same answer. Scroll down  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
not sure but we could both be thinking of an orange kangaroo from Denmark  
  
Next time I will make you think of green bats who wear glasses

# Decisions, decisions. Where is my magic 8 ball?
#### October 23, 2021 

I did pretty well last Chemo session. I had a private room for 95% of my time but it was the chair and not a bed. Still was able to catch a few Z's  
  
Still feeling the effects of chemo and not enjoying them. I typically require 4 days after pump disconnect to feel normal again. The docs say 2 days should do it but they are wrong. So I am looking forward to Monday. Sort of. On Monday, I get a full CT scan, Tuesday is more bloodwork and Wednesday we meet with the oncologist. It has been at the back of my mind since the appointments were made a few weeks back.  
  
Yes, this is the big appointment. We are not sure what news we will receive. I suspect that I am far from done with the treatments just due to the way I feel, but we would love to hear some positive proof that all this effort is making a difference.   
  
I have shared some of the little lessons I have learned during this illness. I will share one that I learned long time ago (in a galaxy far away...) kidding. I was at a crossroads. We have all been there. We are stuck looking at the fork in the road. We ponder, and wonder which path we are to take. We measure the possibilities and try to account for pros and cons. However, certainty is not guaranteed. There are some decisions that we make that are life changing and monumental. Other decisions are as simple as the choice between fries and salad. Sorry, the rabbit food is just not going to make it. For the faithful, we exercise prayer, searching the word, seeking wise counsel and devoted thoughts to the choices presented.  Sometimes the answer is clear and others not.  
  
The cruelest of these decisions is when you have to choose between the lesser of two evils. Both paths do not offer much encouragement but you are still forced to make a decision. Bummer.   
  
I was given choices at the beginning of our adventure and chose to take the treatment path. To me, it was an easy decision. Life is so precious, such a incredible gift, you are ready to fight tooth and nail to preserve it. But I have seen close those who have fought and are losing. I see the despair in their faces, hear the surrender in the voice and sense the loss they anticipate. It is difficult to watch. My prayer request is to be spared such feelings. Not the easiest request in the world. We are driven by emotion and feelings and confused by logic and fact. It does not change the fact that God is in control, but sometimes harder to see it.

My cancer diagnosis was a total surprise. Nothing prepared us for the news. All we knew that I was suffering from chronic cough and had experienced chest pain or an ache. It started with visiting the doctor again with a similar complaint. That led to tests: Blood work, Electrocardiogram, Xrays, CT scan, Bonescan yadda yadda. This time the result was nodules on several organs which are tiny little tumours. Then some of the nodules were called tumours. Then they called us in for a consultation. They called it inoperable Stage 4 Cancer. Our story is constantly changing. And my lesson still holds.   
  
The lesson I learned? You cannot see around a curve.  
  
I got this image long ago while driving. We were in the Blackhills driving through spectacular terrain. Very cool to drive through a mountain, we don’t get a lot here on the prairies. I was making a hard right turn somewhere on our route and had to stop very fast or else I would have plowed into someone. They chose to stop in the tunnel as they believed they were oversized and needed guidance to navigate out of it. Poor driver but all was well. I couldn’t shake that feeling of being caught by surprise. I couldn’t see around the bend. The sheer rock face was blocking my view.

It is similar with the decision making process too. For all the effort we put in, we cannot always expect our desired result. We patients choose to suffer various effects of treatment only to sometimes get disappointed. We cannot see around the curve. God’s plan is bigger than I am. Please do not confuse this statement with a sense of surrender. We are shown how to pray and why to pray and when to pray etc. Sometimes nothing changes. I choose to feel that this lapse in progress is preparation for tougher times ahead. Sometimes I feel nothing. Emotions are hard on sick people and worst for those terminal. But feelings are not fact. I have made dozens of wrong decisions based on feelings. I am very happy to say that I made more correct decisions based on feelings. The biggest one was pursuing the beauty that would one day say “I do”. No regrets. On the 24th we celebrate her birthday (39 again?) and then there will be some decisions to make. Easy ones like what to eat or do we have ice cream with cake. Then later this week we will have some bigger decisions to make and I humbly ask you remember  us in your prayer times.  I believe the biggest help you can get in seeing around the curve is to ask for it. **A**sk **S**eek **K**nock.

# Houston, we have a problem....
#### October 15, 2021 

Oh happy day. I did my regular blood test and passed. (I didn’t even study). On Monday I get to go and visit Cancer Care for another round of chemotherapy.  I am on track and today feeling fine. (The pretzel was great) Glad that everything is working out on schedule

I hope I get a private room. There are 30 medi chairs on the Chemo treatment floor. These are large, oversized chairs designed to keep you comfortable while you spend your hours during infusion. My treatment is about 2 hours, so comfort is a high priority. The chairs have a built-in foot stool and can recline like a typical Lay-z-boy (keep your comments to yourself). There are also working platforms for each arm for the staff to do their magic. For me, today it was blood test and dressing change (the chance to scratch). The chair also has an extendable footrest. I am an average 5’ 10 yet my feet will dangle if I sit back fully in this giant chair. From my description I hope you envision an appropriate representation of the chair. I attached a picture of one and posted in the gallery. However, I said I wanted a private room. You see, in most of the private rooms you get to have…a bed. Now this isn’t a gel foam memory topper mattress which requires small parachutes to make fitted sheets. It is a typical hospital bed but the beauty of it is the peace and quiet of being alone in a room and granted the opportunity to partake in a little slumber while the machines whirr away. Nothing makes time pass by faster than sleeping through it. With the chair, odds are against a nap. With the bed, I feel I have a great shot of some shut eye. So there is my selfish confession today. I am hoping to score a bed on Monday and hopefully get out on the right side of it.

This is my wish or desire. It is not really a plan as I have no control where they schedule me. I would like to meet the scheduling nurse and see what it takes to get bumped up to preferential treatment selection. I am sure she will accept a bribe  listen to my reasoning.

It is a shared experience we all have of making the best plans and then have them waylaid by some unseen force or circumstance. In the defense of my fellow cancer patients, we did not plan for this. I can say with some confidence that we didn’t want it either. I heard of a fellow who upon diagnosis was only given three weeks before he would succumb to the illness. I was given a term of six months and there are many who have been provided a timeline of years. There is ALWAYS a caveat that the doctors will say. They say under current circumstances. Or to the best of our knowledge. The human body is God’s complex work and even the medical world cannot guarantee the reactions of one patient versus the next. I agree that generalizations may be made but specifics cannot. While I react one way to treatment, another person may not benefit. So we march on and live optimistically and hope that things work out. Let’s be honest, the death rate for us all is the same. It’s one apiece. The question most of us pose or avoid is WHEN. You see I had plans for this summer. It did not include making a regular pilgrimage to the hospital. I even had some longer-term plans for next year. They have been put on hold. Though vague I have spent time thinking of plans for children's graduations, weddings, grandkids and dare I say retirement. Ok that last one is far fetched. I am on the freedom 85 plan. You can make all the plans you want but life has a way of changing them. These events will take you by surprise but not God. No, He is not shaken by the sudden changes in your circumstances. Does God want me to have cancer? No. Does He allow it? So far the answer is yes. Now the big one that I have never addressed: WHY?  
  
I will not share at this time my own answer for why. I have one and am prepared to share it but this is not the time. I have even been asked but politely I will keep my reasonings to myself. Maybe I am guaranteeing some future readers if I hold out. HA.  
  
I will return to the matter of interrupted plans. They can be a minor irritant (had to cancel hair appointment because the car broke down. A guy can dream can’t he?) They can be life changing (the answer to a dozen of marriage proposals. Personally, it took hundreds of requests before I finally said yes) And they can be tragic (an expectant mother laying in a coma with dwindling chances of survival and talk of choosing between mother and baby) Seldom are the unexpected plans a good experience.  
  
How do you react when you face the curveball? Looking back, I am not sure of how we took the news. I know that almost immediately and constantly since then we have had it at the top of our prayer life. Friends and family have joined in and thus we are at peace for the moment and trusting in God. The time has not been wasted either. He has shown me much and some of it I have had the privilege of sharing with you. We did not have many options. The oncologist spent 2 hours with us, educating us and providing guidance and ultimately choices (we picked the treatment route obviously). But the change in plans was totally out of our control. Our only choice was to turn to God. It shouldn’t be like a last resort either. We are taught to pray without ceasing and to ask, seek and knock. Our first response to anything, crisis or not, should be sharing with God in prayer. I encourage you to pray through your next emergency. Instead of struggling to find answers on your own, go to Lord humbly with your burden. And you don’t have to do it alone. Reach out and tell someone your struggle. Many hands make the load lighter. If the matter is extremely personal and sharing details will make it seem worse, then don’t provide them, just share that you want that support. God know all the details, even the ones that you don’t.

My late father-in-law was 94 at his passing and many would say he was a prayer warrior. His first reaction to anything would be to start praying. That wasn’t a natural response that he was born with, but he had decades of life experience to realize it was the best way to face the issue. It became a definition of his person, a man who loved to talk to God. That is a goal I strive for. I may not have decades left to practice what I preach but I want to share my problems with the Almighty and not carry them by myself, a guy who can’t figure out the tv remote.

17:22 time

> I didn’t sleep well last night. In fact, I was up all night and finally drifted to sleep around dawn. I slept in and missed my initial doctor appointment. Unfortunately, my better half also slept in. Apparently, something kept her from sleeping all night too. I woke with a start and scrambled around trying to make the appointment time. I was running around like a confused chicken. My plans had a serious interruption, but everything worked out in the end. I just hate being late. I hate the idea of inconveniencing others for my tardiness. This is a trait that has not been passed down to the next generation. Their idea of a 7:00 meeting is to leave the house at 6:59. There has been many clashes over our philosophies on time management. Running late is not exercise either. We have been so late for church at times, I just say we are early for the next service. I had another appointment last night and drove halfway downtown when I realized I left an important document at home and had to return to get it (chemo fog). The detour cost about 15 minutes total and I made my appointment, but I was doing that chicken impression again. In both of these instances, I admit that I did not start praying and fasting right away. Things worked out but could have been worse. I guess at one time or another we all play victim to being late. Even one of my doctors came into the room 15 minutes after out appointment started and the first thing he said was “sorry I am so late”.  I replied “its OK, I am patient”

# Happy Gobble Gobble Day.
#### October 7, 2021 

A short word here and brief encouragement.

It is Thanksgiving weekend and many will be spending time with friends and family. Typically a pleasant time and for those who make the point to truly be thankful for what we have. 

This year the day, the phrase, the meaning of thanksgiving has taken on a new significance for me. I am sure it has similar meaning for others who have been diagnosed as terminal and are buying time with treatment. As I have written before, everyday that my name is not in the obituary section is a good day and I will give Thanks. 

I have lots to be grateful for despite my negative health situation:

My relationship with God and my salvation.  
My beautiful wife of 29 years  
My three incredible children (another day another gray x 3)  
My family scattered here and abroad who have done so much  
My friends who have blessed us in material ways and have surprised us with tokens and words of encouragement. You will never know how much it means to us, me in particular.  
Those same friends who spend their precious time visiting and those who keep me in their prayers. God has met our needs through you.  
My health for what it is. I had to rush to an appointment today and within a minute I was exhausted, winded, achy and a little lightheaded. I brought it on myself by overdoing it. But in comparison to being bed ridden and hooked up to tube and machines, I am pretty grateful.  
Pretzels, ice cream, smoothies, the weather, my little lap dog Trixie, skip the dishes, napping, and dozens of small blessings that can add a smile to my situation.

Yes being thankful can be difficult sometimes. Especially when life seems to be dumping down around you. But I will say to you “do you want to trade?” Most people will not and for those who do, I recommend seeking some professional, sympathetic counsel. The hardest part of any battle is fighting alone. You are never alone, you can feel lonely but you are never alone. Share with someone. 

And here is my offer. I want to pray for you. I am setting aside time on Thanksgiving to petition God on behalf of all my friends, family, and followers of my little blog here. I see that I have a large number of readers but a much smaller number of registered followers. I humbly ask of you to sign up so that I know you and lift you up to our mighty God. Or contact me directly or even through Kathy and her space book or face place phone app. Please send me a specific request if you are comfortable. The bible teaches us how to pray in many passages, being specific is one. In addition to how to pray, there is what, where, when, who and why. The bible is thorough on the matter. If you are listed as a follower you can know without doubt that on Monday and amongst other times, I will be praying specifically for you and giving thanks. I will also be praying for the anonymous reader so count yourself regardless, but I would so appreciate knowing who my supporters are. It lifts the spirits so much.  

To wrap this up, I echo the words from Philippians 1 :3  

> I thank my God every time I remember you.

And

[First Thessalonians 5:16–18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Thess%205.16%E2%80%9318) says 

> "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, **give thanks in all circumstances**; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." 

In all circumstances, wow, now that is a challenge. I may not succeed but I will certainly try. And I will have a special time on Monday and I hope to include you. God bless all.


17:22 time

Have a wonderful weekend

# Do you hear what I hear?
#### September 30, 2021

Hello Voters, 

Pretzel day has arrived. I had the pleasure of partaking in one of my favorite rituals, getting a hot soft bready delight from the mall. My preference is just plain old butter and salt. Though today may have been extra buttery (easy down, easy out), it was delicious. Prior to my culinary task I had to go in for my regular blood work. I am pleased to say that everything came back positive, and I am set for another round of Chemo on Monday. The typical rules still apply, watch what you eat, rest often, take your medications, do not scarf an entire plate of hot wings, listen to your body, etc. 

Last Sunday was one of the most challenging physical nights of my illness. The side effects had taken their full toll and I was victim to several hours of agony. I will not even attempt to describe the experience in words, but it was basically equivalent to time in the pit or a Saturday at Costco during Christmas. It took more than a day to recover, and I shudder to think of ever going down that road again. Hence why I am happy to continue with the treatments. It is frustrating as it seems that there is no progress but only 6 weeks left in phase 1. 

It is during these events when my sleep pattern gets challenged. I know it happens to a lot of folks so I cannot just blame the cancer or treatment, but I am sure we all have those times when we just can’t sleep. In the wee hours of the morning, I wake up and there is no earthly way that I am just going to drop off to sleep again. I am restless and my mind goes EVERYWHERE. This happens way too  often.  I typically go to the living room couch to “sleep” so I do not disturb the empress with my alertness. No, I am not banished to the couch, I just choose to take position there out of consideration for Kathy so she can get the rest she deserves. Besides if I wake her that is where I will end up anyway. 

It is amazing how loud silence can be. I lay there and can almost hear my own heartbeat. The house has its own sounds of course and some foreign noises come from outside the walls, but the silence drives you to the thunder of your own thoughts. I think worry is a natural response at these times. During the day, we are just too busy, overstimulated and overworked to let it take control. But at night there is less competition for our thoughts, and we chase them to dark outcomes. To be honest it is good to have the chance to sit and clearly think through an issue. Unfortunately, due to the body’s fatigue and need for rest we sometimes do not have the strength to see things other than in a negative light. There are legitimate reasons for concern, and they deserve to occupy our thoughts and time. Imagine if all our decisions were based on a minute of time. There would be lots of regret out there. It is normal to believe that the more serious an issue is, the more time we spend contemplating it.  Now can you imagine what a terminal patient thinks of during these attacks of solitude: How long do I have left? Will I suffer more? What about my family? What happens next? Then slowly as you begin to get tired the questions become more deep: Will the Bombers make it? The Jets? Did I turn out the basement light? When I drink grape juice and then pee, where did the purple go? I digress but think it is safe to say we all have experience wrestling with our thoughts. What keeps us from losing? 

I have faith. It is simple, but beyond definition. It is real but I cannot let you hold it. Words cannot describe it as it is more than a feeling. It is living but dwells in the smallest place. At it weakest, it can move mountains. When I share it, it doesn’t diminish but grows. It has no monetary value, but it is priceless. It is mine alone, but millions have it. Faith. Bible says in 1 Cor 13 “ And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.” Yeah, but faith was first. You cannot please God without faith. Heb13:6. That is where I go during my midnight meditations. I choose to believe, to exercise faith, that God is in control. It is not simple or easy. My doubts are just as real but not as strong. But I choose to believe God has this. He has a plan for me. Jer 29:11 What makes me think that it should be my plan. Why should I be exempt from life’s challenges, problems, and pain. Yes, I would rather not have experienced Cancer but even in all it’s ugliness, I have drawn closer to God. And my faith has grown. To my friends who will admit they are faith challenged I have nothing to offer you other than my weak example. One thing I did not say about faith is that it is personal. I cannot let you experience my faith because it is unique to me as all my life’s experiences. I will say that I encourage you to explore finding or growing your faith. Like a muscle it gets stronger with use, more reliable over time and a greater umbrella for trials than any logic can provide. It also is a source of comfort. Those nighttime sessions that can cause so much grief are easier to handle when you can lessen the burden with faith. It is not a “set it and forget it” application, it is a continual act of choosing to believe. If anyone ever needs a word of encouragement or prayer to kickstart your faith, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I have been practicing a lot lately. Sickness may drag me down a lot more often but faith also sustains me for the long run. I have learned to not compare myself with others. I see a lot of familiar faces at Cancer Care. I can see fellow patients suffering and know they are not doing well. In fact, if you play the comparison game you will lose, there will always be someone worse off than you. “I cried because I had no shoes until I met a man who had no feet.” 

17:22

> I mentioned in paragraph one that I was supposed to listen to my body. Or in other words do not ignore the warning signs my body is giving me. Listening to my body is a challenge. I went for months with symptoms but kept putting off seeing the doctor. I’ll just walk it off. OR This will pass. I had to realize I am no longer twenty something.

I have tried them all, and some are weird.  It is a side effect of the meds and passes but almost painful to (**HIC**) deal with. Fortunately we found a solution. (back to the couch)

# Dale the optimist?
#### September 16, 2021 

My white blood cells have returned to an acceptable level, and I return to Chemotherapy on Monday. I prayed for this to happen. Many friends and family prayed for this to happen. Even strangers, people whom I have never met prayed for me. This is due to friends sharing their burdens and cares and word spreads. To everyone, thank you so much. Your prayers have helped put me back on healing path. I have described that journey before, and I don’t look forward to it, but it has to be done. Due to my changing health, they are changing the medicine I receive. Yay I love being a guinea pig but I am moving forward.

 I am trying to be optimistic about everything. I mean everyday your name is not in the obituaries must be a good day. I also look at what Cancer has brought to my table:

- I don’t have to worry about dieting. I have lost 50 lbs since Christmas. Yes I was overweight but now I have levelled off. I may have lost a little too much.
- I have saved a bundle on haircuts. Since most of it fell out, there isn’t anything to cut.
- I have been conditioned to swallow pills. I have never had to take regular medicine in my life and now there is a plethora of pills on my shelf which I can now swallow.
- I have taken time away from work and have truly begun to rest, good side effect for a workaholic.
- I have gotten a lot of sleep. The pain killer really takes me down a notch or two so I tend to nap a lot.
- I may have Brain Fog or Chemo Brain sometimes. This is just a good excuse for my diminishing grey cells.
- I have seen and experienced firsthand the incredible generosity of friends and family. I cannot express my gratitude enough for all the emails, cards, words of encouragement, visits and the tangible expressions of gift cards, meals, etc. Wow, it has lifted us up so much.
- I have spent more time with God. Last night I was awake again for several hours. It happens a lot. Sometimes it is the pain and sometimes it is just being adrift in my thoughts. It is not always a positive experience. I worry. I fret. I get anxious. I doubt. But then I pray, I seek the word. It is not always an instant change but I eventually sleep. My faith is deepening.
- I eat a lot of pretzels.

So there are the positives about my current condition.

I said earlier that prayer brought me to this place of continuation of treatment. I know that there are some who ask 'What if God didn’t answer your prayer". Friends, God always answers prayer. In my situation He said yes.

Sometimes the answer is no. 

Many times the answer is wait. 

The bible states that His thoughts are higher than my thoughts, His ways are higher than my ways. As high as earth is from heaven.  Isa 55:8-9  That is quite the span. I am so glad God’s reach covers most of it.

Keep praying.


17:22 time


> Man in Prayer: Oh God, you are so vast, so great, so powerful. What is time to you? 
> 
> God: A million years is like a second of time 
> 
> Man: You are so awesome, so loving and so generous. What riches could I give you? 
> 
> God: A million dollars is like a penny. 
> 
> Man: God, can I have a penny? 
> 
> God: Sure, just a second.  
 

Old one but a good one. 

Happy pretzel day.

# Wait for it...
#### September 10, 2021 

I have a had a good week. A really good week, not quite great but really good. I connected with a few friends and old colleagues and spent some time with newer friends. It started with celebrating my birthday on the holiday Monday. We had everyone over for a small feast and capped it off with an ice cream log from the DQ. Chaotic but nice. The following days were similar. I kept busy with different things and spent some time in cheery visits. We have also been blessed by some wonderful folks with gift cards to ease the burden of meal planning/preparing. That was so appreciated. Pretzel day came and lived up to the expectations but then Cancer Care called me. Apparently, my feeling good is wrong. I shouldn’t be feeling good. My white blood cells are lower than ever, and I am supposed to be sick. Thank you Nurse Feelgood. That being said, I have another weeklong vacation from treatment. This time I am a little discouraged. I hate delaying my treatment. I want to get better as soon as possible. Waiting is causing me anger, fear, doubt and frustration. So much for feeling good. I will covet your thoughts and prayers over the next week while WBC try to fight their way back. This is part of the battle. Waiting.

I have had multiple trips to the hospital for treatments, blood tests, and consultations. The staff down at Cancer Care is amazing. I am so impressed with their compassion and dedication as I have gotten to know some of the nurses. One nurse told me that the staff there all chose that role and love making a difference there. It is typically a ward that doesn’t have a lot of good news so to work there is a special dedication. Even the admin staff rate very high. I have only waited once past my appointment time. Out of all the visits, only once did I have to sit and wait until they called me. Try that anywhere else. I can see the reasoning behind the drive to stay on schedule. Most of us patients aren’t there by choice. Time is a valuable commodity to us and to waste it sitting around is quite aggravating.

Patience is a virtue, they say. Even though I may be shortlisted on my remaining time I feel the need to practice being patient. I will vent a little here and say if you have been standing in a line up and have waited to get to the counter to start making your decision. Get out of the line. Here is a big surprise, the menu hasn’t changed and reading it several times over doesn’t change it either. The apostle Paul hits it right away it 1 Corinthians 13. It has been referred to as the love chapter. I think we all agree that the world needs a little more love. The bible says it, the Beatles said it, so did Dumbledore but I will take my direction from the good book. Trying to define love is tricky but Paul gives us the definition in chapter 13 and he nails it as the first thing he says is Love is patient. Wow, I have bombed that one several times.

_Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails._ 1 Cor 13:4-8

In fact as I look at the list, I can be honest enough to say that I have dropped the ball on several others too.

Jesus said the greatest commandment was to love God with all your heart, soul and mind. The second greatest was to love your neighbor as yourself. Logically if we follow scripture and love our neighbor, we are patient with him. It was a lawyer who asked Jesus “who is my neighbor?” Jesus replied with the story of the good Samaritan. Culturally, Samaritans were reviled by the Jewish community. It was the Samaritan who showed mercy and kindness. Jesus used this extreme to demonstrate that everyone is your neighbor. This means not only family and friends but strangers too. 

Good patience comes from practice. Practice means effort. Effort means work and we all love to avoid work. But from my challenged health perspective, I see the need to be patient which is to show love. I hope you see it too.

My Prayer: “Lord, please give me patience. Now.” Or something like that.

17:22 time.

> It is that season. Fall is approaching but the season is here. It is the confluence of both the increase of activity of work and school and the last efforts to finish construction season. So we all get a little impatient in traffic. I mean some of it makes no sense. Like putting up barriers days before work begins. Or closing lanes without warning. Or closing lanes several blocks before the work thus eliminating escape routes.
> 
> I was in bumper-to-bumper traffic yesterday. It was midday and no where near rush hour. We were all dragging at 35 KPH. I took notice of a car behind me showing aggressive signs. At one point they ducked quickly into the right hand lane, gunned the accelerator to the max and passed me only to cut in front of me due to a parked car. He was stuck there for several blocks and then made the mad dash to the right lane again. I lost sight of him for a few minutes but soon caught up to him.
> 
> He was stopped.
> 
> He was stopped with another car.
> 
> Another car with flashing lights on it.
> 
> Flashing red and blue lights.
> 
> You can guess the rest. I tried to calculate it. All his efforts to beat time may have won him an extra 2 minutes at the end. I am sure the ticket will demonstrate it better than I can.

# Turn turn turn
#### September 2, 2021

Hello Campers

It is pretzel day. Since most of you know the routine, I will just jump in and say blood work came back and the doc called right away. I failed. Once again the white blood cells are too low to safely begin a treatment session. They want to buy me another week before trying again. _Cue sad violin music_

A little discouraging. Part of me is glad to delay the awful aspects of the treatment (that would be the prior, mid and post medicine infusion). The other side is unhappy that we are delaying the plan. This small delay puts everything else back another week or more. I had tests and visits booked all the way to the end of October. It is hard to get this over with when you are being constantly rescheduled.  A lot of reorganizing to do but I refuse to be negative about it as it would not benefit in any way. So, I will **choose** to be happy about not being ill (ironic statement eh). _Cue happy Irish fiddle music_

I have been called witty and clever and a wordsmith for my venting on this forum. Thanks to you all, you are being very kind. I just needed an avenue to unload and you are my unfortunate victims.

I have a theme going through my head right now of time. As a locksmith I deal with a count down timer on safes and vaults. _Cue majestic symphony music_ When used properly, the timer only allows the container to open after the timer has completed its pre set lock out window. Lots of banks get locked out of their vaults by not setting these devices correctly or as I say an abuse of time. Typically happens on long weekends when the bank clerks have to add an extra day of being closed. Confused by adding a simple extra 24 hours, they wind up putting the bank out of business while the timer has to tick away whatever extra hours were inadvertently added. I have included a picture of this device from my collection. The piece is about 120 years old and still works like a charm. But time remains constant. You cannot make it go faster, or slower, though dentists may have this ability. You cannot change the simple nature of time moving at its natural pace. God created time, the Swiss just found a way to measure it. There are specific moments in time that are universal too.

If I say the following you have the immediate answer:

- 12:00AM                         your answer is midnight
- Noon                            your answer is 12:00 PM
- December 25                     Your answer is Christmas
- February 14                     Your answer is that Hallmark fraud Valentines day
- January 1                       Your answer is New Years day

Those are generic. Try these:

- Dec 7 1941                      Japan bombs Pearl Harbor
- September 11 2001               World Trade Center Attack
- April 1
- July 1
- October 31
- Nov 11 1918 at the 11th hour

Here’s one: **September 4 1968**

Give up? My birthday (thanks in advance)

I am not the only who has been fascinated by time:

A stitch in time thus saves nine, Time is money, Time waits for no one, no time like the present, its Miller time, time flies, let the good times roll etc

Even the music industry has been drawn into the mystery of time

- No time left to lose                            The Guess Who             
- Does anybody really know what time it is?       Chicago
- Time in a bottle                                Jim Croce
- Feels like the first time                       Foreigner
- Too much time on my hands                       Styxx
- Only time will tell                             Asia
- If I can turn back time                         Cher
- Wasting my time                                 Default

Even those hippie folk rockers from the 60’s, the Byrds, made a song regarding time called Turn, turn, turn. It is based on the wise words of King Solomon from the 3rd Chapter of Ecclesiastes. There is a time allowed for all things. I encourage you to read verses 1-8 and appreciate God’s wisdom. There are seasons for each circumstance. You don’t sing Kool and the Gang “celebrate good times” at Aunt Bertha’s funeral. And you don’t mourn and wail at the love union of a wedding (unless you are father of the bride). And you certainly don’t laugh hysterically while doing your tax return.  I think we all know of a wound we had years ago has been partially healed by time.  Truly a mystery ,  it is deserving of the time spent on trying to understand it. Pun intended.

Friends if you or someone you know are like me are having a difficult time or season, gently remind them of those golden words in Ecc chapter 3. People with terminal illness are tossed about in a storm of emotion in the uncertainty of life. Feelings are powerful forces that make or break individuals. Uplifting and destructive at the same time. You dont even have to be in my boat and be ill. Your struggle is your own and you must not compare your issues with others. The pain is personal but the solution is universal. I believe the key to survival is Turn Turn Turn. Knowing, trying, attempting to apply the right outlook to your current circumstance.  When these match, we are in a better place.  And when we lack, God supplies. I just need to practice what I preach.

So back to the beginning. I am in a time of waiting right now. If you are able, remember me while I am in penalty box. Not what I wanted but hey, its only for a season.


Yesterday is gone forever

Tomorrow may never come

Today is a gift from God and that’s why it is called the present



The bible? Ancient greeks? Age of enlightenment?   Nope Kung Fu Panda 2

# The Regular Poutine, uh I mean Routine
#### August 31, 2021 

I hate to say it but summer is essentially over. Oh, we still may get loads of nice weather but school starts soon, people are travelling even less and there is an expectation of falling into a regular routine of life. I don’t mind. I like the familiar. I like the known and comfortable. I mean who doesn’t.

As a cancer patient undergoing a treatment program I have adapted to new schedule of “normal”. Most of this is based around my new need for doctor appointments, treatments and tests. The new normal takes me down a different path but it too becomes more familiar with every passing week. I see the same faces at the clinic, go through the same procedures with the meds. Suffer the same reactions of the side effects. I have alluded that the highlight of my week is running off to get a soft pretzel after blood tests on Thursdays. I have also been on a mission to discover a new ice cream place or treat. Happy to say that I am still progressing on that adventure as there are so many choices. Thanks to my brother for pointing out this great challenge. (side note: In Grand Forks and scattered USA there is a burger place called CULVERS. Great food but better ice cream. They call it Frozen Custard and if you pick up a medium sundae with Hot Fudge and fresh Raspberries, you will thank me eternally. Unfortunately, a trip to the promised land still seems to be a million miles away.)

My latest passion is a calling for POUTINE. Now a lot of folks don’t get excited by the humble spud but it is a staple with me as it is comfort food. I like my taters smashed, mashed, smushed, roasted, toasted, baked, boiled, fried, scalloped, sliced and diced, cubed and shredded and formed like tots. The bonus is having them come with gravy, sour cream or cheese, onions and shrooms, ketchup, salt pepper and vinegar (but none of that malt stuff, eeeyuw.) They can come with various accompaniments. Pulled Pork, Mexican beef, grilled veggies, Roast beast etc. Even perogies can be credited with a relationship to poutine. They all score high with this local lockpicker. If I have a point, it is finding some joy or peace or comfort in the mundane. You don’t get any more dull than the potato. I love it. And before any of you takes up the mantle and tries to build me a deep fried starch kingdom, I am doing fine. You mention a small concern about snack overpricing and boom, you are the pretzel fascist of North Kildonan. I so appreciate everyone’s efforts, comments and recipes from my past ravings. Really it was encouraging. I knew that I wasn’t alone. I have had visitors, emails and phone calls but there are still dark days when you just don’t feel like putting your best foot forward. My friends, you have made those days seldom and few so enjoy your own pretzel. Thank you.

My recent appreciation for food is more than just finding something to keep down. If there is a message is my culinary ravings it is finding simple comfort in simple food (cue the ugly kid/food critic from Ratatouille). It actually goes beyond food. What makes a person feel better than a good meal? Doing something to lift up someone’s day. Whether it be a known or anonymous action, sincere but unexpected words of appreciation or just bringing a little sunshine into someone’s life. Today, can we challenge ourselves to go the extra mile at least once. I am not asking you to apply for sainthood or heaven forbid, actually allow someone to zipper into your traffic lane. Just one word or action done to purposefully make someone’s day better. They had a term for them in the old days, manners. The people like this are optimists. Most folks appreciate them and tend to gravitate towards them as their attitude is refreshing. Heaven forbid I return to my thundercloud without a daily attempt to bring joy to someone else. Most times I do this by leaving a room but new rules apply now. Time is just too short and valuable to whine.

Paul wrote to the church in Philippi 

> “Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky **16** as you hold firmly to the word of life... (Phil4:13-16)

What a promise. What a challenge What a reward. To not complain or argue. To shine like stars in the sky. Try to remember that when you are looking at your next plate of potatoes. You’ll be surprised.

Happy Post Pretzel Day sports fans. That's Friday to the normal people out there.

Thanks to everyone who knows me well enough to realize that Pretzel Day came and went and are looking for the health update. I did my bloodwork as per the norm and then had full conference with the good doctor.  Good News, I am healthy enough to begin another Chemo round. Bad News, I have to face another Chemo round. I get to enjoy this weekend and start my infusions on Monday to Wednesday and then recovery. Deja Vu.  So for those who lift me me up during treatment week, a big thank you and here we go again. We will post if there becomes a sudden or urgent need.

I enjoyed the rain today. My better half and I ran errands in the morning and then enjoyed a time of quiet reflective meditation in the early afternoon. OK, we took a nap, but it was still nice. It is too bad that my recovery from treatment takes so much out of me as I enjoyed the showers. I was never the most energetic and active guy but I didn't get winded chasing a thought either. No, today was nice and I give thanks for it. Downside came when I got a call from my beautiful daughter who was across town with my car. "dad, car broke. It is overheating" .  That was her greeting.  I wanted to say " I am feeling fine, thank you for asking. No you don't have to pick me up a treat as a thanks for taking my car and using my gas."  Instead my reply was" Be right there" Managed to get out there, pick her up and even bring back my wounded wagon. Now I have something more to look forward to next week while dealing with _the healing process._  Some will say when it rains it pours.

I like the saying. I like rain.  When my father passed I was comforted by the gentle tapping on the hospital window. When my oldest Brent was born we also looked out the hospital window and "counted raindrops". I love the coolness of the air.  The cleansing of the ground. The quiet powerful rhythm of puddles forming.   In fact I am such a fan of precipitation that I use rain  in all my passwords.

Probably didn't need to mention that. 

That little phrase is from the pessimistic side of life inferring that not only do bad things happen but they happen a lot. Could be true, but that is forcing a view through a colored glass. Bible tells me that unfortunate things can happen to anyone at anytime.  Our old friend Job sure suffered. Forget about pouring, poor guy went though a tsunami of suffering. But he didn't give up on God. I will not get into a deep philosophy on why bad things happen to good people. Bad things happen. Good things happen. Most of the time nothing happens. We go through the day with neither extreme of blessing or curse. That's life. I think a little suffering can be a good thing. Builds character, makes us value things a little better if there was an sweat investment. It teaches us to persevere as well. That if it is worth having then it is worth working for it. Having to "suffer" during the  healing  and treatment is *nothing compared to the alternative*. So getting sick when I am already ill, broken car, washing machine and dishwasher slowly fritzing out. It is just a little rain. None of this surprises God. He is still in control and I am not.

Let that be all prayers. I will not give up, no matter how much it pours. After all, I am already wet.

Good night. Love you all but I have to change some passwords.

Dale

# Round 2
#### August 13, 2021 

Round 2:

I managed to survive another treatment round. It was everything we expected. The discomfort, frustration, emotional upheaval, and misery and complaining. Kathy was terrible. It even began to rub off on me too.

No, in reality Kathy was once again a solid rock while I was in this hurricane of illness. Now no one enjoys getting sick, but I rejoiced at bit once the vomiting began and then subsided. The getting over it part.  I can describe the details of my sink and toilet pretty well preferring the former to the latter. No one wants to put their face in a place that was not built for their face. Luckily Kathy saw the future days before treatment and that bowl was cleaner than the day it was made. I gotta say Granada makes a pretty comfy bowl. Good height, appropriate amount of cool and convenient handle. I said I was happy when vomiting began and subsided. Relief is a better word. I certainly would rather be doing a dozen other things besides playing “Finding Chemo” on my knees or hunched over the sink.  It is the getting past that point which is satisfying. Like last time, I need almost the full week to perk up again. But I have my family, friends, and some very confused telemarketers. Here is hoping to a good week ahead. I haven’t kept things down as I should, but small improvements are coming.

Just a word of thanks here. I know so many people are praying and reaching out with gifts of food, words of encouragement and even some sly humour. As time drags on for us, we fear the support will diminish too. It is only human nature to get acclimated or accustomed to a circumstance. I will be wholly honest and ask for your continued support. There were many hours that sleep wasn’t available, and I began to feel rest only because I KNEW someone somewhere was praying. And only prayer moves the hand of God. So, a big thank you for you taking the time for either me or Kathy. We will try to reach out as time and circumstances allow.

17:22 time.

> As you know I had a lot of hair which is taking a leave of absence. My beautiful daughter has locks like Crystal Gale, my youngest son looks like Forrest Gump during his running phase, and my partner for life should be in a shampoo commercial. My poor drains. And vacuum cleaner. Carpet. Pillowcases. Everywhere I look in house, I see these tufts of dark grey/brown fur. I am reminded of my old chinchilla, but it is me and my kin. So, apologies in advance for any brave enough to cross our threshold. You may pick up a strand or two. And we hope a day comes soon where we will be able to throw open the doors of our home and welcome you in good news.

> Just bring a lint roller.

# Power of Suggestion
#### August 6, 2021 

Today is Friday campers. That means by all logic that yesterday was Thursday and every second Thursday is blood work day. Yay. It is not all bad. After the tests my lovely wife and I take the opportunity to treat ourselves to a nice hot soft pretzel. (you can see prior entries if you cant follow this). Thanks to a generous benefactor who provided means and direction, Thursdays which was blood work days, is now pretzel day. All you got to do find the bright side.  
  
Speaking of which, my blood work had come back positive. There are enough WBC to safely begin a Chemo treatment. Monday at 11:00 I get my infusion and then carry the Chemo pump around with me until Wednesday. If there is a time to say a prayer it is then. I feel a bit under the weather today and the last two days but it is nothing compared to treatment day. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger must have been coined by a cancer patient.  
  
Back to pretzel day. The blood test is done in the morning and the lab processes it by mid afternoon. They check various things to make sure I am fit for treatment. It is also the day they change the dressing on my picc line. For those uncertain, a PICC line is a tube that runs in my left arm across my chest and then down to the top of the heart. It contains an adaptor valve where all medicine is given and all blood is drawn, otherwise I would look like a junkie with dozens of track marks on my arms. I have lost count of the number of vials those vampires have drawn from me. It was not easy putting it in, either narrow veins or trouble finding a heart.  
  
Changing the dressing is routine. They do it a dozen times a day. I actually had no issue with this foreign object imbedded in my arm even though it restricts freedom and movement. But three weeks ago I had the nurse change the dressing that was the same one who installed the Picc Line. She is a bubbly thing and friendly. Chit chatting away to take the attention off my arm. I said it felt fine, but honestly looks terrible. There she was inspecting her workmanship. I can tell it was a moment of pride for her. The full functioning device that she installed as one of the many components designed to save my life. She asked routine questions: how did it feel, have I had any issues, etc. Then she said it. "Is it itchy?" I casually replied no and let her continue with the task. Now since that day, I have had an itch that cannot be scratched or remotely satisfied. I can scratch above the dressing, below the dressing and to the left and right of it but I cannot touch ground zero. What kind of X-Men mind power does she possess by merely asking a question that now leaves me on the desert path of wanting to claw away at this cheap light plastic bandage. I went on Amazon to find those cones that dogs wear. I figured if I can neutralize my hand i would be safe. It may stop me from scratching but not from being itchy.  Yesterday I offered the new nurse a thousand dollars for sixty seconds alone and some steel wool. No takers. The arm was bandage free for about a minute. One glorious minute. 60 seconds of aaahhh. Then the new dressing was applied.  
  
Shortest bail ever.  
  
Everyone take care. Hope to update next week.

# Hair today part 2
#### July 31, 2021 

Not sure when it happened, but it did. I was looking in the mirror  a few years ago and saw some age. A little bit of grey around my temples. A couple of laugh lines carved permanently on the face. I didn't mind. I had some miles now and these were the scars. After all I was married, father of three and occupied an important position in my career. These were war wounds of life.  
  
What I didn't appreciate were some new comers that also came with the landscaping of time. Rogue hairs that started growing without encouragement. It was weird, all of a sudden I had bushy eyebrows like a muppet. Also on the invasion were a small cropping of hair growing out of my ear. .!?&;??  
  
I did not like it. It was ugly and unkept looking. So I did what most of us do, I shaved, clipped and cut the offenders away. Tried to pull once, only once. So for the past several years it has been a part of my ritual grooming, done quietly and begrudgingly  
  
Fast forward to recently. The cancer fighting drugs I take have nasty side effects like alopecia, the loss of ones hair. Tonight was quite traumatic as I washed 90% of my hair off my scalp. Perhaps more. I mean they were jumping of my scalp like a bunch of hippee bungee jumpers that forgot to fasten the giant elastic bands to make them return. Ever wash a shedding dog? I mean it just doesn't stop. Well I eventually leave the sanctuary of hot water and look at what is left in the mirror. I was born with more than this, even have photos to,prove it. So as the shock fades  I give myself a pep talk I notice a little silver hair. On my ear. I give it a gentle pull because there is enough there to grab onto. It stays. In fact it has a couple of friends too. They are taking root like an overturned South American government. Now I am mulling over, maintenance or plan the worlds craziest comb over? There is irony here. Want what we don't have and wallow in the pity of appearance. Or something like that.  
  
a friend bought me a hat today. Very nice as it is light, doesn't bother my irritated scalp and keeps the sun off. Those beautiful UV rays are really not good for me. I had to make a public thanks.   
  
My ranting tonight is a poor admission of valuable time wasted looking at the outside. I mean it is fine to look presentable but society teaches us that the only value is in beauty. That's just straw that's gone through the cow. That single act of giving me a hat shows me the true value of a person.  All you good folks who check on me in this forum are showing me that too. Thank you.   
  
So here's  the update: blood work on Thursday, Chemo scheduled to start next Monday. Appreciate those prayers.  
  
My little prayer: God, please help me, all of us, to be more than just a mile wide and  an inch deep. Let us all make an impact. Amen.  
  
Even though I am sick, please don't feel that I cannot help. I am still the same person and trying to be more.  
  
just with less hair.  
  
talk next week😉

# Hair Today, Gone tomorrow
#### July 29, 2021 

I better write this sooner than later as folks are looking for the information. My blood work came back and still was not good enough to attempt a treatment. I will get another week off. That sounds like a treat but messing up with the healing schedule. I will admit emotions are running everywhere at the moment.

Todays word is called ALOPECIA which is a condition that most chemos get incurring hair loss. For my entire life I have been blessed with thick, course, strong dark hair. In recent years it has oxidized a bit and turned a little silver and white. Thank you to my children for making this true: _Another day, Another grey._ In fact you would think that I have lived many days by judging from the natural high lights in my hair. Let's face it, I am a human Chia Pet. For most folks the difference between a good hair cut and bad was a week. For me it is mere hours.

I am blessed to have a "stylist" who cuts my hair but goes beyond. In the last 34 years there have been only 2 ladies to take scissors to my head. Granted, she takes direction from wife (hence why my mullet has never returned) but still does a great job. It is going to be easier for her now as Alopecia has attacked me with a vengeance. My hair is not just falling out but jumping right off my head. I am shedding like a sheep dog. Now I am not that vain but I miss my follicles. That mop on top was part of my identity. Now it is just another side effect. I remember an event where my previous stylist went all out to make a "do" to last the long day. Vanilla shampoo, mint conditioner, strawberry mousse, mixed berry hair gel, coconut holding spray  and almond and cherry bark spiking medium.  It wasn't a hair cut but a recipe. Still not as good as my recent mop chopper.

A big thank you to my sister who found me painters hats to wear. I wanted these as these are light, cotton and not totally nerdy. Some ballcaps are just too hard, hot, or heavy. My scalp still feeling medical effects so I am looking for some other options. The painters caps are just a little tight on my big head. Best option for going out in public right now .  I look like someone who mixed up hair remover and shampoo. If it isn't turning grey, it's turning loose.

I share because laughter is best medicine. And yes, I am laughing a bit. Can't believe we used to be so serious about looks. I am rolling eyes here. The other medicine that works is the visits, emails, texts and calls from my friends. I am blown away by their compassion, actions and words. And I am trying to reply to everyone when I can. Just so very tired so often. But those interactions energize me. I have been especially blessed this past week. To everyone who prays, please know I am saying one for you too.  And I will reach out to you when I can

Please continue to pray that conditions get better. As I said emotions are running wild **but God has a plan**. He is just smart enough not to show me all at once.

Hello all,

Today was not filled with good news over all. I had a couple of meetings/appointments today . Pik line check up and blood work went as scheduled. The follow up not so great

I have Neutropenia. It is just a condition describing low white blood cell count.  Nothing  earth moving but not ideal for Chemo patients. The gist of it is that I am not strong enough to begin my second round which was scheduled for Monday. Good and Bad. I wasn't looking forward to beginning another round but now i am forced to delay another week. My White Blood Cell count has to triple by next Thursday. I don't know how hard that will be.  I can do nothing to speed things along. My body will react in its own way. This is not unheard of either. About 20% of chemos cannot begin as scheduled as planned. This is one of the reasons.

So I am getting more organized and informed as time goes on.  My specific prayer request is that this old shell starts pumping out WBC where we can (ugh) start a Chemo session. Also the incredible pain in my shoulder and back. I do not want to dive deeper into the pain killer track ( thank you to all advocates of edibles but now is not the right time). Grace is provided for all things but these are my immediate needs and struggles. Thanks to everyone for reaching out.  It is humbling to see how many people care.  Bless you all.


Let me sign off with an incredible experience today. As you know my appetite is way down and so is my energy and weight. Kathy and  I decided to grab a bite between the Good and the Bad today so we zipped over to Polo Park. I hit up the pretzel shop on the north side. Those who know me know I love a hot pretzel, in fact all white breads.  Imagine the warmish concoction  ripped into small pieces, some lightly brushed and others dripping with melted butter.  I chose the original which is lightly cascaded with large salt. Half of it melts in you mouth, The other bands together and tries to resist breaking down as you chew it. It is stronger than bread and weaker than a bagel, the texture is a perfect mix. The taste is indescribable as one second it is  sweet and the next salty.  To top it off, they sell Raspberry and Cherry Slush puppies.  a very light sweet slurpee that never seems to satisfy but it washes down the pretzel perfectly.

I have my own vision of heaven. And in the corner there is my own private pretzel stand. And the best part.......I dont have to pay a stinking _4 bucks for a hunk of bread!!_  I mean it is good but come on, we are talking about  some flour egg and water. That won't stop me next time but 4 bucks? I am sure there is crack in it. Really. $4 a pretzel works out to what $160 a loaf of bread. Yeah I know what you are thinking. The Chemo Fog is hitting his brain already.  Take care everyone, love you all.

round 1 is over. Almost. Still fighting all the side effects but they will pass in days to come. I then get 4-5 days off before going back for tests. thanks to everyone who sent messages, verses and encouragement. It means so much. It helps in those dark hours.

Please dont give up one me yet. I cant imagine doing this alone. I have already made a promise to myself that WHEN i an done, I am going to volunteer In some fashion. 

As for not being alone: I cannot thank my beautiful wife of 29 years for taking the mantle for 'for better, for worse and in sickness and in health' . She truly is a marvel and has met every need. Kathy I love u so much and thank you for everything

It has been a couple of weeks since we were sat down and told the news of my cancer. There was nothing good about it, just cold dark facts. We treat each day as its own and rely on God's grace. The outpouring of support from friends and family has been amazing. I really hope that one day a can show the same support.  
  
I have been searching for a saying, verse, motto or something to act as my go to. I am leaning with 8:28  Thats all. And when people ask, I am ready to tell them. Can you figure it out?
