## Full job description

Taiv is a fast-growing tech startup located in Winnipeg, Canada. Taiv uses AI to make business TV more fun, engaging, profitable, and easier to manage, starting with bars and restaurants. We’ve built proprietary tech that uses computer vision to watch live TV and improve the content with contextually-aware commercials, content, and games. Our tech also automates the manual AV tasks that venues have to do every day, to make bar management easier, standardized, and more profitable. We’re venture-capital backed and graduated from Y Combinator, the world’s top tech accelerator, in winter 2020. Program alumni include Airbnb, Instacart, DoorDash, etc. (www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies).

**Who We're Looking For:**

We're looking for a full stack developer who works hard and wants to get in early and grow with the company. We develop hardware, firmware, web, android, and ML. Your role will be mostly focused on Android, web, and backend, but we're a small team and everyone wears a lot of hats. There's always room to grow in whichever area you enjoy the most! You'll have lots of responsibility and ownership of the projects that you work on and be integral in solving our toughest problems and building systems that will scale to millions.

**Our Tech:**

We have really cool tech - we build our own hardware and use a heuristics-based computer vision approach for classification. We’re the first (and only) company in the world that can detect TV commercials accurately. Our detection algorithm runs on our custom-designed TV box that we manufacture in-house. We have thousands of boxes deployed across 750+ venues and are installing more every day. We also have several web apps built in React that are used by our customers, as well as for internal operations.
