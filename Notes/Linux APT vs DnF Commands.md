| APT command                                      | DNF command                                                 | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apt install`<br><br>`apt-get install`           | `dnf install`                                               | Of course, actual package names may vary. For example, `libc6-dev` on Debian maps to `glibc-devel` in the Fedora universe.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `apt install --only-upgrade package`             | `dnf update package`                                        | Updates only already installed package and its dependencies. The `apt install` works for both install and upgrade single package if already installed.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `apt update`<br><br>`apt-get update`             | `dnf check-update`                                          | This command is rarely needed, as dnf updates its package cache automatically when it is stale. A cache update can be forced by appending `--refresh` to other commands, e.g. `dnf upgrade --refresh`.                                                                                                  |
| `apt upgrade`<br><br>`apt-get upgrade`           | `dnf upgrade`                                               | Note that while `apt update` does something different, `dnf update` and `dnf upgrade` are synonyms. You can also use the shorter `dnf up`.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `apt full-upgrade`<br><br>`apt-get dist-upgrade` | `dnf distro-sync` or<br><br>`dnf system-upgrade` (see note) | While `distro-sync` is the most direct functional equivalent, `dnf system-upgrade` should be used to upgrade from one release to another, e.g. from Fedora Linux 34 to 35. This is a multi-step process as described [here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/upgrading-fedora-offline/). |
| `apt remove`<br><br>`apt-get remove`             | `dnf remove`                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `apt purge`<br><br>`apt-get purge`               | ---                                                         | Fedora packages donâ€™t treat configuration files in the same way as Debian packages, so there is no direct equivalent.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `apt autoremove`<br><br>`apt-get autoremove`     | `dnf autoremove`                                            | Note that this can occasionally remove packages that you might actually want. Use `dnf mark` to flag packages to keep.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `apt search`<br><br>`apt-cache search`           | `dnf search`                                                | `dnf repoquery` is useful for advanced searches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

With the exceptions of the distribution upgrade working differently, and DNF updating the cache automatically, the commands are very similar. More info on DNF can be found [here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/).
