````ad-info
title: What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is JavaScript running on the server. It is a JavaScript runtime environment, *not* a programming language. 

The *runtime* is something that provides custom functionality such as various tools or libraries specific for an environment. 



````

```ad-question
title: Why Node.js?

It uses an event-driven, asyncronous [[Input Output | I/O]] model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Node.js is asyncronous because it allows us to process multiple requests at the exact same time for different users. Ex. fetching data for User 1 and deleting data for User 2.
