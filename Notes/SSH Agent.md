title: What is a SSH Agent?

An SSH agent is a program that manages [[SSH]] keys. SSH keys are used for authentication when connecting to remote servers securely. The SSH agent holds the private keys securely in memory and provides them to SSH client programs when needed, so you don't have to type in your passphrase every time you connect to a server.
