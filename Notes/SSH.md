title: What is SSH?

**Secure Shell (SSH)** is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an unsecured network. It provides a secure way to access and manage remote servers. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the user to authenticate themselves to the remote computer.

This is frequently used when working with Git repositories hosted on services like GitHub or Bitbucket, or deploying applications to platforms like Heroku.
